Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries
of the world and their capitals and every prime number 
up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no 
understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be 
touched. And he detests the color yellow.
Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, for 
fifteen-year-old Christopher everyday interactions and 
admonishments have little meaning. He lives on patterns, 
rules, and a diagram kept in his pocket. Then one day, 
a neighbour's dog, Wellington, is killed and his 
carefully constructive universe is threatened. 
Christopher sets out to solve the murder in the style of 
his favourite (logical) detective, Sherlock Holmes. What 
follows makes for a novel that is funny, poignant and 
fascinating in its portrayal of a person whose curse and 
blessing are a mind that perceives the world entirely 
literally." onmouseover="this.width=155;this.height=185;" style="cursor: pointer;" onmouseout="this.width=160;this.height=190" width="160" height="190"></a></p>

In 2015, Miller was sexually assaulted by 
Turner on Stanford University's campus. Two 
Swedish graduate students were passing 
by on bikes and chased Turner off an 
unconscious Miller. Turner was convicted 
of three felonies but served only three 
months of a six-month sentence in county 
jail. The case became notorious for its 
illustration of the race and wealth gap 
in sentencing, and for the stinging 
eloquence of Miller's victim statement, 
which went instantly viral when it was 
published.
Know My Name is a devastating, immersive

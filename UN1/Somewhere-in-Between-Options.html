The exams are finally over, the sun is shining and celebration 
is in the air. For twins Chloe and Alex the future looks bright, 
if a bit uncertain. But turbulence is not far from the horizon. 
It begins when Alex is in a car crash on the way home from a 
drinking binge with friends. Miraculously he escapes with just 
cuts and bruises, but the driver's life hangs in the balance. 
Alex tells himself it's only a matter of time before his friend 
'wakes up', but his free and easy ways are put to the ultimate 
test over the dramatic weeks to follow. For Chloe, insecurities 
begin chip away at the edges of her 'balanced' world: her 
relationship with Sam, her drama school chances, her weight. 
Her friends are worried that she's getting too thin. But thin is 
not what Chloe sees when she looks in the mirror. A holiday to 
Ayia Napa with the gang promises to be the escape everyone 
needs, the ideal bridge between school and ... real life. But as 
the party rages on, Alex and Chloe realise that there are some 
things that you can't escape from - as they struggle to find the 
somewhere at the other side of somewhere in between." width="175" height="185">

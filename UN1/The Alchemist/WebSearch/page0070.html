He had succeeded in reachingthrough to the Soul of the World, and now the price for having done so might behis life. It was a frightening bet. But he had been making risky bets ever sincethe day he had sold his sheep to pursue his Personal Legend.

If hedied tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds, and hewas proud of that.Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground bya wind such as he had never known. The area was swirling in dust so intensethat it hid the moon from view. Before him was an enormous white horse,rearing over him with a frightening scream.When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw.Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a falconperched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban and his entire face, except forhis eyes, was covered with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a messengerfrom the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a meremessenger.The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbardmounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â he demanded,so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the fifty thousand palm treesof Al-Fayoum.

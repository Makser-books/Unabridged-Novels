He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on tellingstories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear andsurprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day wouldnever end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days.He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before:the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with the raven hair, hisdays would never be the same again.But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep.He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year. AND  NOW  IT  WAS  ONLY  FOUR  DAYS  BEFORE  HE  WOULD  BE  back  in  that  samevillage.  He  was  excited,  and  at  the  same  time  uneasy:  maybe  the  girl  hadalready forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool.

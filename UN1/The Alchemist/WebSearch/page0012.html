They never have to make any decisions, he thought.

As long asthe boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be hisfriends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hoursbetween sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives,and didnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities.They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generouslygave of their wool, their company, andÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âonce in a whileÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âtheir meat.If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, theywould become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, thoughtthe boy.

Maybe  the  church,  with  thesycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to have thesame dream for a second time, and it was causing him to feel anger toward hisfaithful  companions.  He  drank  a  bit  from  the  wine  that  remained  from  hisdinner of the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. Heknew that a few hours from now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be sogreat that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It was thetime of day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The heat lasted untilnightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought tocomplain about the burden of its weight, he remembered that, because he hadthe jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for thejacketÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s weight and warmth.The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was totravel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all thecities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to the girl how itwas that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminaryuntil  he  was  sixteen.  His  parents  had  wanted  him  to  become  a  priest,  and

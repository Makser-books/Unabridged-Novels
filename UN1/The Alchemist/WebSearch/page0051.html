When thecaravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a largerocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the sand was too fine for theanimalsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. Insome  places,  the  ground  was  covered  with  the  salt  of  dried-up  lakes.  Theanimals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismountand unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves oversuch treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fallill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detoursand adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass point.Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on a star thatindicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in themorning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees,shelter, and other people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of allthis; he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first fewdays  of  the  journey.  But  he  found  it  much  more  interesting  to  observe  thecaravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned to know his camelbetter,  and  to  establish  a  relationship  with  him,  he  threw  the  book  away.Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened thebook he would learn something important, he decided it was an unnecessaryburden.He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. Atnight, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures asa shepherd.During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“I used to live near El Cairum,ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â he said.

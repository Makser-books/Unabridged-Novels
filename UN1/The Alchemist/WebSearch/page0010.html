THE BOYÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢S NAME WAS SANTIAGO. DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with hisherd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormoussycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood.He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep enteredthrough the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flockfrom wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, butonce an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend theentire next day searching for it.He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had justfinished  reading  as  a  pillow.  He  told  himself  that  he  would  have  to  startreading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the starsthrough the half-destroyed roof.I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dreamthat night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that stillslept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also beganto stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep,with  whom  he  had  spent  the  past  two  years,  leading  them  through  thecountryside in search of food and water. ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are so used to me that theyknow my schedule,ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â he muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realizedthat  it  could  be  the  other  way  around:  that  it  was  he  who  had  becomeaccustomed to their schedule.But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boyprodded  them,  one  by  one,  with  his  crook,  calling  each  by  name.  He  hadalways believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So therewere times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impressionon him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of ashepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things hehad seen in the villages they passed.But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: thegirl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in

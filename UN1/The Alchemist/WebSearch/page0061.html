They were on the right track.Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. Shehad a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her facewas uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of theWorld surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that herlips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most importantpart of the language that all the world spokeÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âthe language that everyone onearth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something olderthan humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the sameforce whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well.

The omen he had sought to findwith his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just asthe universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt atthat moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, andthat, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was morecertain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents andgrandparents  that  he  must  fall  in  love  and  really  know  a  person  beforebecoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had never learnedthe universal language. Because, when you know that language, itÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s easy tounderstand that someone in the world awaits you, whether itÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s in the middle ofthe desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter eachother, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There isonly that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun hasbeen written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates atwin  soul  for  every  person  in  the  world.

In  two  years  he  hadlearned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear sheep, how tocare for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves.

From there, he could see Africa in thedistance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors hadcome, to occupy all of Spain.He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plazawhere he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I met that old man, hethought. He had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret hisdream.

He  knew  that  wind:  people  called  it  thelevanter, because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the eastern endof the Mediterranean.The levanter increased in intensity.

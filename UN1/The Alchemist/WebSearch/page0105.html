ABOUT THE AUTHORPAULO COELHO was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the city where he nowlives.  His  own  life  has  in  many  ways  been  as  varied  and  unusual  as  theprotagonists of his internationally acclaimed novels. Like them, Paulo Coelhohas followed a dream in a quest for fulfillment. His own dream, to be a writer,met with frustration throughout much of his early adult life, a time in which heworked  at  various  professions,  some  of  them  materially  rewarding  butspiritually unfulfilling. ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“I always knew,ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â he says, ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“that my Personal Legend, touse a term from alchemy, was to write.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â He was thirty-eight when he publishedhis first book.In 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him, he traveled throughmuch  of  South  America,  North  Africa,  Mexico,  and  Europe.  Returning  toBrazil after two years, he began a successful career as popular songwriter. In1974, he was imprisoned for a short time by the military dictatorship then rulingin Brazil. In 1980, he experienced one of the defining moments of his life: hewalked  the  five  hundred-plus  mile  Road  of  Santiago  de  Compostela  innorthwestern Spain. On this ancient highway, used for centuries by pilgrimsfrom France to get to the cathedral said to house the remains of St. James, heachieved a self-awareness and a spiritual awakening that he later described inThe Pilgrimage.Paulo  Coelho  once  said  that  following  your  dream  is  like  learning  aforeign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in the end. In1988,  he  published  The  Alchemist,  a  novel  that  explores  this  theme,  and  itlaunched him as an international bestselling author. Specifically, Paulo Coelhois recognized for his powerful storytelling technique and the profound spiritualinsights he blends seamlessly into his parables. Since then, The Alchemist hassold more than twenty million copies worldwide and has been translated intosome fifty-six languages. In addition to The Pilgrimage and The  Alchemist,Paulo Coelho has written luminous novels about the different streams of ourlives, including By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, The Valkyries, TheFifth Mountain, and Veronika Decides to Die. A winner of numerous literaryprizes, Paulo Coelho is also a prominent speaker for humanitarian causes. In1999,  he  received  a  Crystal  Award  for  Artistic  Achievement  at  the  Davos

courage to turn around.All around him was the market, with people coming and going, shoutingand buying, and the aroma of strange foodsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦but nowhere could he find hisnew companion.The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separatedfrom him by accident. He decided to stay right there and await his return. As hewaited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby tower and began his chant;everyone  in  the  market  fell  to  their  knees,  touched  their  foreheads  to  theground,  and  took  up  the  chant.  Then,  like  a  colony  of  worker  ants,  theydismantled their stalls and left.The  sun  began  its  departure,  as  well.  The  boy  watched  it  through  itstrajectory  for  some  time,  until  it  was  hidden  behind  the  white  housessurrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that morning, hewas  on  another  continent,  still  a  shepherd  with  sixty  sheep,  and  lookingforward to meeting with a girl. That morning he had known everything that wasgoing to happen to him as he walked through the familiar fields. But now, asthe sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land,where he couldnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, andhe had nothing, not even the money to return and start everything over.All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He wasfeeling  sorry  for  himself,  and  lamenting  the  fact  that  his  life  could  havechanged so suddenly and so drastically.He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in frontof his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and he was far from home,so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and because this was the wayGod repaid those who believed in their dreams.When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy.People saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But now IÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢m sad andalone.

But all he found was theheavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old man had given him.As  he  looked  at  the  stones,  he  felt  relieved  for  some  reason.

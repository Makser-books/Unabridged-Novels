He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, Ican learn to understand the world.Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrowstreets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to read the omens. Heknew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds know all about patience.Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the same lessonshe had learned with his sheep.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“All things are one,ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â the old man had said. THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT AWOKE WITH THE DAY, AND FELT the same anxiety that hefelt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at thetop  of  a  hilly  street  where  few  customers  passed.  Now  it  was  too  late  tochange anythingÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âthe only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sellcrystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop:Arab merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who werealways well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be selling crystal,and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women athis side as he grew older.But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta hadgrown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away,and there remained only a few small shops on the hill. And no one was goingto climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops.But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his lifebuying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else.He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings inthe street. He had done this for years, and knew the schedule of everyone whopassed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in front of the shop. He wasdressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see thatthe boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delayhis lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.

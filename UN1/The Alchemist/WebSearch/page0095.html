The boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so, he sensed that theuniverse had fallen silent, and he decided not to speak.A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was aprayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words orpleas. His prayer didnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures; itdidnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t beseech thatthe woman he had met continue to await his return. In the silence, the boyunderstood that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understandthe signs written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths, and tounderstand what had been written on a single emerald. He saw that omenswere scattered throughout the earth and in space, and that there was no reasonor significance attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts,nor the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created. Butthat the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could performmiracles, or transform the sea into a desertÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦or a man into the wind. Becauseonly  the  hand  understood  that  it  was  a  larger  design  that  had  moved  theuniverse to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a MasterWork.The boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it was apart of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul.And that he, a boy, could perform miracles. THE SIMUM BLEW  THAT  DAY  AS  IT  HAD  NEVER  BLOWN before. For generationsthereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who had turned himself intothe wind, almost destroying a military camp, in defiance of the most powerfulchief in the desert.When the simum ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place where theboy had been. But he was no longer there; he was standing next to a sand-covered sentinel, on the far side of the camp.The men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people whowere smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect disciple, and thechief, because that disciple had understood the glory of God.The following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist farewell,and  provided  them  with  an  escort  party  to  accompany  them  as  far  as  theychose.

much time with him.So  the  boy  was  disappointed;  he  decided  that  he  would  never  againbelieve in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of things he had totake care of: he went to the market for something to eat, he traded his book forone that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could samplethe new wine he had bought.

The men of the oasis wanted to know if they hadseen any fighting, and the women competed with one another for access to thecloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the desertwas  a  distant  dream;  the  travelers  in  the  caravan  were  talking  incessantly,laughing and shouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world andfound themselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved andhappy.They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driverexplained  to  the  boy  that  oases  were  always  considered  to  be  neutralterritories, because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children.There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert,leaving the oases as places of refuge.

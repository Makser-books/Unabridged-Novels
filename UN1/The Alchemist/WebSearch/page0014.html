THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED, AND SUDDENLY THE sun appeared. The boythought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had alreadyseen many castles and met many women (but none the equal of the one whoawaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he couldtrade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able everyday to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he couldsell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea, hewould already have known other cities, other women, and other chances to behappy.

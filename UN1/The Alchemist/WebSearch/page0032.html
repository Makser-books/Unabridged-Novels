one.After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places.Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than anyshepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how different things are just twohours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at themoment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it wasteeming with life, and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. Ithurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As hemused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking ofhimself  as  the  poor  victim  of  a  thief  and  as  an  adventurer  in  quest  of  histreasure.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢m an adventurer, looking for treasure,ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â he said to himself. HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE. HE had fallen asleep in themiddle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to resume.Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in anew world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy. He no longer had toseek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in search of his treasure,instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, thenight  before,  that  he  would  be  as  much  an  adventurer  as  the  ones  he  hadadmired in books.He  walked  slowly  through  the  market.

I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins
that said that: ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing
the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â I went outside, looked up at
the  sky,  and  thought  to  myself:  ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“So,  the  book  is  going  to  be  published  in

follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible.
And  little  by  little,  my  dream  was  becoming  reality.  Ten,  a  hundred,  a
thousand, a million copies sold in America. One day, a Brazilian journalist
phoned to say that President Clinton had been photographed reading the book.
Some time later, when I was in Turkey, I opened the magazine Vanity Fair and
there was Julia Roberts declaring that she adored the book. Walking alone
down a street in Miami, I heard a girl telling her mother: ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“You must read The

The book has been translated into fifty-six languages, has sold more than
twenty  million  copies,  and  people  are  beginning  to  ask:  WhatÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s  the  secret
behind such a huge success?
The only honest response is: I donÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t know. All I know is that, like Santiago
the shepherd boy, we all need to be aware of our personal calling. What is a
personal calling? It is GodÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s blessing, it is the path that God chose for you here
on Earth. Whenever we do something that fills us with enthusiasm, we are
following our legend. However, we donÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t all have the courage to confront our
own dream.
Why?
There are four obstacles. First: we are told from childhood onward that
everything we want to do is impossible. We grow up with this idea, and as the
years  accumulate,  so  too  do  the  layers  of  prejudice,  fear,  and  guilt.  There
comes a time when our personal calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be
invisible. But itÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s still there.
If we have the courage to disinter dream, we are then faced by the second
obstacle: love. We know what we want to do, but are afraid of hurting those
around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream. We do not
realize that love is just a further impetus, not something that will prevent us]]></text>

This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly

Translated by Clifford E. Landers
THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had brought.
Leafing through the pages, he found a story about Narcissus.
The  alchemist  knew  the  legend  of  Narcissus,  a  youth  who  knelt  daily
beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so fascinated by himself
that, one morning, he fell into the lake and drowned. At the spot where he fell,
a flower was born, which was called the narcissus.
But this was not how the author of the book ended the story.
He said that when Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest appeared
and found the lake, which had been fresh water, transformed into a lake of salty
tears.

herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous
sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood.
He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered
through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock
from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, but
once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the
entire next day searching for it.
He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just
finished  reading  as  a  pillow.  He  told  himself  that  he  would  have  to  start
reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.
It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars
through the half-destroyed roof.
I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream
that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.
He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still
slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began
to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep,
with  whom  he  had  spent  the  past  two  years,  leading  them  through  the
countryside in search of food and water. ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are so used to me that they

that  it  could  be  the  other  way  around:  that  it  was  he  who  had  become
accustomed to their schedule.
But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy
prodded  them,  one  by  one,  with  his  crook,  calling  each  by  name.  He  had
always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So there
were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression
on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a
shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he
had seen in the villages they passed.
But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the
girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in]]></text>

merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded that
the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend
had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.

The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her
question. He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling
stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and
surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would
never end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days.
He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before:
the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with the raven hair, his
days would never be the same again.
But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep.
He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year.
 
AND  NOW  IT  WAS  ONLY  FOUR  DAYS  BEFORE  HE  WOULD  BE  back  in  that  same
village.  He  was  excited,  and  at  the  same  time  uneasy:  maybe  the  girl  had
already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool.]]></text>

But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like
seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was
someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.
The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of
the sun. They never have to make any decisions, he thought. Maybe thatÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s why

The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as
the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his
friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours
between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives,

If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they
would become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought
the boy. They trust me, and theyÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts,
because I lead them to nourishment.
The  boy  was  surprised  at  his  thoughts.  Maybe  the  church,  with  the
sycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to have the
same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to feel anger toward his
faithful  companions.  He  drank  a  bit  from  the  wine  that  remained  from  his
dinner of the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He
knew that a few hours from now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so
great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It was the
time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until
nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought to
complain about the burden of its weight, he remembered that, because he had
the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.
We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the
jacketÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s weight and warmth.
The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to
travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the
cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to the girl how it
was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary
until  he  was  sixteen.  His  parents  had  wanted  him  to  become  a  priest,  and]]></text>

thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already
seen many castles and met many women (but none the equal of the one who
awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he could
trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every
day to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could
sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea, he
would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances to be

Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been

many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had only to allow his
sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting
things.

said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It was also said that they had
a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away

So  the  boy  was  disappointed;  he  decided  that  he  would  never  again
believe in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of things he had to
take care of: he went to the market for something to eat, he traded his book for
one that was thicker, and he found a bench in the plaza where he could sample
the new wine he had bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing.
The sheep were at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a friend.

clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or

He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before
following his flock back through the fields. Three days from now, he would be
with the merchantÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s daughter.
He  started  to  read  the  book  he  had  bought.  On  the  very  first  page  it
described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people involved were very
difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, he thought, he would present
one  person  at  a  time,  so  that  the  reader  wouldnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t  have  to  worry  about
memorizing a lot of names.
When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, he liked
the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he welcomed the feeling of
being cold. As he read on, an old man sat down at his side and tried to strike
up a conversation.

capable  of  doing  difficult  things.  He  had  already  imagined  the  scene  many
times; every time, the girl became fascinated when he explained that the sheep
had to be sheared from back to front. He also tried to remember some good
stories to relate as he sheared the sheep. Most of them he had read in books,]]></text>

And he vanished around the corner of the plaza.
 
THE  BOY  BEGAN  AGAIN  TO  READ  HIS  BOOK,  BUT  HE  WAS  NO  longer  able  to
concentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old man was
right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of bread, thinking about
whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him.

decided to say nothing. If he were to say anything, the baker would spend three
days thinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to the way
things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the
baker. So he began to wander through the city, and found himself at the gates.

While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock,
and  decided  he  should  go  back  to  being  a  shepherd.  In  two  years  he  had
learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear sheep, how to
care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He knew
all the fields and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price
for every one of his animals.
He decided to return to his friendÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s stable by the longest route possible. As
he walked past the cityÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the stone
ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he could see Africa in the
distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had
come, to occupy all of Spain.
He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza
where he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I met that old man, he
thought. He had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his
dream. Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that
he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in
things, and didnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep. He
knew everything about each member of his flock: he knew which ones were
lame, which one was to give birth two months from now, and which were the
laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever
decided to leave them, they would suffer.
The  wind  began  to  pick  up.  He  knew  that  wind:  people  called  it  the
levanter, because on it the Moors had come from the Levant at the eastern end
of the Mediterranean.
The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my
treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between something he had become
accustomed  to  and  something  he  wanted  to  have.  There  was  also  the

I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten
used to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get used to my not being
there, too, the boy thought.
From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come
and go from the bakerÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he had

The
levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force on his face. That wind
had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell of the desert and
of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who
had once left to search for the unknown, and for gold and adventureÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âand for
the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he
could  have  the  same  freedom.  There  was  nothing  to  hold  him  back  except
himself. The sheep, the merchantÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s daughter, and the fields of Andalusia were

and excited by so much change. All they wanted was food and water.
Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the

again after having charged him his one-tenth fee. That was his work.

HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS, THOUGHT THE BOY.
He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the
narrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that
they passed from one to the other. In just a few hours he had seen men walking
hand in hand, women with their faces covered, and priests that climbed to the
tops of towers and chantedÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âas everyone about him went to their knees and

always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his white horse,
his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these kneeling at his feet. The boy
felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels had an evil look about them.
Besides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, just one
detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long time: only Arabic
was spoken in this country.
The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a drink that
had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a bitter tea. The boy
preferred wine.

     <text><![CDATA[The sale of his sheep had left him with enough money in his pouch, and the boy
knew that in money there was magic; whoever has money is never really alone.
Before long, maybe in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old

The  old  man  had  spoken  about  signs  and  omens,  and,  as  the  boy  was
crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old man had known
what he was talking about: during the time the boy had spent in the fields of
Andalusia,  he  had  become  used  to  learning  which  path  he  should  take  by
observing the ground and the sky. He had discovered that the presence of a
certain bird meant that a snake was nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign
that there was water in the area. The sheep had taught him that.
If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he thought, and
that made him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter.

The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who

He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The

The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him

They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere
there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the center of a large plaza
where the market was held. There were thousands of people there, arguing,
selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed
alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all,
he had all his money. He thought about asking him to give it back, but decided
that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about the customs of the strange
land he was in.

He knew he was stronger than his
friend.
Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful
sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed in silver, and the handle
was black and encrusted with precious stones. The boy promised himself that,
when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword.

at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had suddenly compressed it.
He  was  afraid  to  look  around,  because  he  knew  what  he  would  find.  He

and buying, and the aroma of strange foodsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦but nowhere could he find his
new companion.
The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated
from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and await his return. As he
waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby tower and began his chant;
everyone  in  the  market  fell  to  their  knees,  touched  their  foreheads  to  the
ground,  and  took  up  the  chant.  Then,  like  a  colony  of  worker  ants,  they
dismantled their stalls and left.
The  sun  began  its  departure,  as  well.  The  boy  watched  it  through  its
trajectory  for  some  time,  until  it  was  hidden  behind  the  white  houses
surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that morning, he
was  on  another  continent,  still  a  shepherd  with  sixty  sheep,  and  looking
forward to meeting with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was
going to happen to him as he walked through the familiar fields. But now, as
the sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land,
where he couldnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, and
he had nothing, not even the money to return and start everything over.
All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was
feeling  sorry  for  himself,  and  lamenting  the  fact  that  his  life  could  have
changed so suddenly and so drastically.
He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front
of his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and he was far from home,
so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and because this was the way
God repaid those who believed in their dreams.
When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy.
People saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But now IÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢m sad and

too insignificant to conquer the world.
He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there
was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship. But all he found was the
heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old man had given him.
As  he  looked  at  the  stones,  he  felt  relieved  for  some  reason.  He  had
exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold]]></text>

be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he could put them
in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful thing his friend had
told him was that port towns are full of thieves.

trying to tell him not to trust that man.

He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and
feeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just handling them made him
feel better. They reminded him of the old man.

The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said.

not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones were proof that he had

experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions, and to do that,
the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old manÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s blessing

He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As
he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the
ground. The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch. He
knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as
he saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.

After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places.
Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any
shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how different things are just two
hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at the
moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it was
teeming with life, and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It
hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he
mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of
himself  as  the  poor  victim  of  a  thief  and  as  an  adventurer  in  quest  of  his
treasure.

HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE. HE had fallen asleep in the
middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to resume.
Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a
new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy. He no longer had to
seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in search of his treasure,
instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the
night  before,  that  he  would  be  as  much  an  adventurer  as  the  ones  he  had
admired in books.
He  walked  slowly  through  the  market.  The  merchants  were  assembling
their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a
smile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was about, and ready

way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized that, while they were
erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.
And they had understood each other perfectly well.]]></text>

Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow
streets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to read the omens. He
knew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds know all about patience.
Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the same lessons
he had learned with his sheep.

THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT AWOKE WITH THE DAY, AND FELT the same anxiety that he
felt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at the
top  of  a  hilly  street  where  few  customers  passed.  Now  it  was  too  late  to
change anythingÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âthe only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell
crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop:
Arab merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who were
always well-heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be selling crystal,
and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women at
his side as he grew older.
But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had
grown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away,
and there remained only a few small shops on the hill. And no one was going
to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops.
But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life
buying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else.
He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in
the street. He had done this for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who
passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in front of the shop. He was
dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that
the boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay
his lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.]]></text>

two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal.

he would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep.

everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way.
 
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED, AND THE SHELF BROUGHT many customers into the
crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he
could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty. In less than a

with  the  Arabs,  because  he  was  now  able  to  speak  their  strange  language.
Since that morning in the marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim
and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was
Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his work, and
thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a
winner.

     <text><![CDATA[THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN. IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since
he had first set foot on the African continent.
He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for
this day. He put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel
skin. Wearing his new sandals, he descended the stairs silently.
The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank
some  hot  tea  from  a  crystal  glass.  Then  he  sat  in  the  sun-filled  doorway,
smoking the hookah.
He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the
wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had finished his smoke, he
reached into one of his pockets, and sat there for a few moments, regarding
what he had withdrawn.
It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty
sheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from Africa into his
own country.

took his jacket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street, the
two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim.
It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long]]></text>

The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange
sensation that the old king was nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and the
omens were that it was time to go.

But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there
was a language in the world that everyone understood, a language the boy had
used throughout the time that he was trying to improve things at the shop. It was
the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and
as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no
longer a strange city, and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he
could conquer the world.

stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten to
mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one
you had before, you should buy it.
The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went
down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two
other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses. It
was more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he stood,
he saw for the first time that the old merchantÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s hair was very much like the

interruption, he was unable to concentrate.
He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able
to understand one thing: making a decision was only the beginning of things.
When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that
will  carry  him  to  places  he  had  never  dreamed  of  when  he  first  made  the
decision.

my decision, but where it goes is going to be a mystery to me.
Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed unfriendly, and
had looked irritated when the boy had entered. They might even have become
friends, but the Englishman closed off the conversation.
The boy closed his book. He felt that he didnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t want to do anything that

But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear what the
Englishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about to describe, though:

The  closer  one  gets  to  realizing  his  Personal  Legend,  the  more  that
Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the boy.
The caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the morning, halted
when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late in the afternoon. The boy
spoke very little with the Englishman, who spent most of his time with his
books.
The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across
the desert. Now everything was quite different from how it was that day they
had set out: then, there had been confusion and shouting, the cries of children
and the whinnying of animals, all mixed with the nervous orders of the guides
and the merchants.
But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the
hoofbeats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very little to one another.

The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having
set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent,
impressed by their elemental force.

thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It seems old and wise.
The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the
fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. It reminded him of the
wool from his sheepÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦his sheep who were now seeking food and water in the

The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the
caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large
rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the sand was too fine for the
animalsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In
some  places,  the  ground  was  covered  with  the  salt  of  dried-up  lakes.  The
animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount
and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves over
such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fall
ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one.
But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours
and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the same compass point.
Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its course, sighting on a star that
indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in the
morning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees,
shelter, and other people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all
this; he was, for the most part, immersed in reading his books.
The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few
days  of  the  journey.  But  he  found  it  much  more  interesting  to  observe  the
caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned to know his camel
better,  and  to  establish  a  relationship  with  him,  he  threw  the  book  away.
Although the boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the
book he would learn something important, he decided it was an unnecessary
burden.
He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At
night, as they sat around the fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures as
a shepherd.
During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.

purification of metals in their laboratories; they believed that, if a metal were
heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and
what was left would be the Soul of the World. This Soul of the World allowed

Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy looked for
the star they followed every night. He thought that the horizon was a bit lower
than it had been, because he seemed to see stars on the desert itself.

THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE. THERE,  IN  FRONT  OF him, where the small
stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date palms, stretching
across the entire desert.

But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the desert, and
he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a long way to go to reach
the Pyramids, and someday this morning would just be a memory. But this was
the  present  momentÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âthe  party  the  camel  driver  had  mentionedÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âand  he
wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future.
Although the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, right
now  it  signified  shade,  water,  and  a  refuge  from  the  war.  Yesterday,  the
camelÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms could herald a
miracle.
The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.
 
THE  TIMES  RUSH  PAST,  AND  SO  DO  THE  CARAVANS, thought the alchemist, as he
watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the oasis. People were
shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the desert sun, and the children of
the oasis were bursting with excitement at the arrival of the strangers. The
alchemist saw the tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse
with him at length.
But  none  of  that  mattered  to  the  alchemist.  He  had  already  seen  many
people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He had seen kings and
beggars walking the desert sands. The dunes were changed constantly by the
wind, yet these were the same sands he had known since he was a child. He
always enjoyed seeing the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after
weeks of yellow sand and blue sky, they first saw the green of the date palms.]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees, he
thought.
He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew that in the
caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets. The

easily to all his creatures.
He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be transmitted this
way because they were made up from the pure life, and this kind of life cannot
be captured in pictures or words.
Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and wind up
forgetting the Language of the World.

impatient to meet with the alchemist.
They  were  surrounded  by  children,  curious  to  look  at  the  animals  and
people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted to know if they had
seen any fighting, and the women competed with one another for access to the
cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the desert
was  a  distant  dream;  the  travelers  in  the  caravan  were  talking  incessantly,
laughing and shouting, as if they had emerged from the spiritual world and
found themselves once again in the world of people. They were relieved and
happy.
They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driver
explained  to  the  boy  that  oases  were  always  considered  to  be  neutral
territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were women and children.
There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert,
leaving the oases as places of refuge.]]></text>

together and gave them his instructions. The group was to remain there at the
oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over. Since they were visitors,
they would have to share living space with those who lived there, and would
be given the best accommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he
asked that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the
men appointed by the tribal chieftains.

persistence and courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed
forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God
along his path.
God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought.
Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world. Like eating
or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a job. He had never thought of them
in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do.

That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman.
The boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a tent with five other
young men of about his age. They were people of the desert, and clamored to
hear his stories about the great cities.
The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them
of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent.

But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.
Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She
had a vessel on her shoulder, and her head was covered by a veil, but her face
was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about the alchemist.
At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the
World surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her
lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important
part of the language that all the world spokeÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âthe language that everyone on
earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older
than humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the same
force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well. She
smiled,  and  that  was  certainly  an  omenÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âthe  omen  he  had  been  awaiting,
without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen he had sought to find
with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.
It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as
the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt at
that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and
that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more
certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and
grandparents  that  he  must  fall  in  love  and  really  know  a  person  before
becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had never learned
the universal language. Because, when you know that language, itÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s easy to

the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each
other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is
only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has
been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a
twin  soul  for  every  person  in  the  world.  Without  such  love,  oneÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s  dreams

The genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed to the
south, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then she filled her
vessel with water and left.
The Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And the boy sat
there  by  the  well  for  a  long  time,  remembering  that  one  day  in  Tarifa  the
levanter had brought to him the perfume of that woman, and realizing that he
had loved her before he even knew she existed. He knew that his love for her
would enable him to discover every treasure in the world.
The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl. To his
surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.

She refilled her vessel and left.
The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told her about
his life as a shepherd, about the king, and about the crystal shop. They became
friends, and except for the fifteen minutes he spent with her, each day seemed

He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned
pink in the setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into the desert, to see if its
silence held the answers to his questions.]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight.
He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his feet. Here and there, he
found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote times, had been a sea. He
sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon. He
tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t
separate them. But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could
help him to understand, it was the desert.
As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. Looking up, he
saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky.
He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their flight
appeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of sense to the boy. It was
just that he couldnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t grasp what it meant. He followed the movement of the
birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe these desert birds could explain
to him the meaning of love without ownership.
He felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted
to sleep. ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am learning the Language of the World, and everything in the world

himself. And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you are in
love, things make even more sense, he thought.
Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking
the other. As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, with
its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis. The vision vanished immediately,
but it had shaken him. He had heard people speak of mirages, and had already
seen  some  himself:  they  were  desires  that,  because  of  their  intensity,
materialized over the sands of the desert. But he certainly didnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t desire that an
army invade the oasis.
He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation. He tried
again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert, and its stones. But there
was something there in his heart that wouldnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t allow him to do so.

The boy recalled what he
had seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going to occur.
He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once again, he
perceived the many languages in the things about him: this time, the desert was
safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous.
The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing the
sunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes.

But the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching their flight
and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World.
The camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew that any
given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history of all things. One
could open a book to any page, or look at a personÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s hand; one could turn a

those things, in themselves, revealed anything at all; it was just that people,
looking at what was occurring around them, could find a means of penetration
to the Soul of the World.
The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with
which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World. They were known as
seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly. Tribesmen were
also wary of consulting them, because it would be impossible to be effective in
battle if one knew that he was fated to die. The tribesmen preferred the taste of
battle, and the thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be; the future was
already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for the good of
man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full
of surprises, and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemyÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s
sword? Where was his horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in
order  to  remain  alive?  The  camel  driver  was  not  a  fighter,  and  he  had
consulted with seers. Many of them had been right about what they said, while
some had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out
(and  the  one  most  to  be  feared)  had  asked  why  the  camel  driver  was  so
interested in the future.

Without  responding,  the  guard  entered  the  tent,  where  he  remained  for
some time. When he emerged, it was with a young Arab, dressed in white and
gold. The boy told the younger man what he had seen, and the man asked him to
wait there. He disappeared into the tent.
Night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and
exited the tent. One by one, the campfires were extinguished, and the oasis fell
as quiet as the desert. Only the lights in the great tent remained. During all this
time, the boy thought about Fatima, and he was still unable to understand his
last conversation with her.
Finally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The boy was
astonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have imagined that, there in
the middle of the desert, there existed a tent like this one. The ground was
covered with the most beautiful carpets he had ever walked upon, and from the
top  of  the  structure  hung  lamps  of  handwrought  gold,  each  with  a  lighted
candle. The tribal chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle,
resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and went with
silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants maintained the fires in
the hookahs. The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke.
There were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately which of
them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white and gold, seated at the
center of the semicircle. At his side was the young Arab the boy had spoken
with earlier.

Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, and the boy
felt better.

said a word up to that point. But the boy was already used to the Language of
the World, and he could feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now
his intuition was that he had been right in coming.
The discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few moments as
they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he turned to the boy: this
time his expression was cold and distant.

in those days, and made the Egyptians the wealthiest of peoples. The Tradition
teaches men how to cross the desert, and how their children should marry. The

The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was over. The
hookahs were extinguished, and the guards stood at attention. The boy made
ready to leave, but the old man spoke again:

When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the light of the
full moon. He was twenty minutes from his tent, and began to make his way
there.
He was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in reaching
through to the Soul of the World, and now the price for having done so might be
his life. It was a frightening bet. But he had been making risky bets ever since
the day he had sold his sheep to pursue his Personal Legend. And, as the camel
driver had said, to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day.
Every day was there to be lived or to mark oneÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s departure from this world.
Everything depended on one word: ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maktub.ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â
Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died tomorrow, it
would be because God was not willing to change the future. He would at least
have died after having crossed the strait, after having worked in a crystal shop,
and after having known the silence of the desert and FatimaÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s eyes. He had
lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he
died tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepherds, and he
was proud of that.
Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to the ground by
a wind such as he had never known. The area was swirling in dust so intense
that it hid the moon from view. Before him was an enormous white horse,
rearing over him with a frightening scream.
When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at what he saw.
Astride the animal was a horseman dressed completely in black, with a falcon
perched on his left shoulder. He wore a turban and his entire face, except for
his eyes, was covered with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a messenger
from the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a mere
messenger.
The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a scabbard
mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon.

The hand with the whip pointed to the south.
The boy had met the alchemist.
 
NEXT MORNING, THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED men scattered throughout
the palm trees at Al-Fayoum. Before the sun had reached its high point, five
hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon. The mounted troops entered the
oasis  from  the  north;  it  appeared  to  be  a  peaceful  expedition,  but  they  all
carried arms hidden in their robes. When they reached the white tent at the
center  of  Al-Fayoum,  they  withdrew  their  scimitars  and  rifles.  And  they
attacked an empty tent.
The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within
half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead. The children had been kept
at  the  other  side  of  a  grove  of  palm  trees,  and  saw  nothing  of  what  had
happened. The women had remained in their tents, praying for the safekeeping
of their husbands, and saw nothing of the battle, either. Were it not for the
bodies there on the ground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the
oasis.
The  only  tribesman  spared  was  the  commander  of  the  battalion.  That
afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who asked him why he
had violated the Tradition. The commander said that his men had been starving
and thirsty, exhausted from many days of battle, and had decided to take the
oasis so as to be able to return to the war.
The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but that the]]></text>

Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet, he was hanged from a dead
palm tree, where his body twisted in the desert wind.
The tribal chieftain called for the boy, and presented him with fifty pieces
of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and asked the boy to
become the counselor of the oasis.
 
WHEN THE SUN HAD SET, AND THE FIRST STARS MADE their appearance, the boy
started to walk to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent, and a group of
Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies. But the
boy sat down and waited.

two dead hawks over his shoulder.

The alchemist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the boy should
enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the oasis. The boy looked
around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy, but saw none. There
were  only  some  books  in  a  pile,  a  small  cooking  stove,  and  the  carpets,
covered with mysterious designs.

The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen on the day
before, but he said nothing. The alchemist lighted the fire, and soon a delicious
aroma filled the tent. It was better than the scent of the hookahs.

ground. There was a hole there among the stones. The alchemist put his hand
into  the  hole,  and  then  his  entire  arm,  up  to  his  shoulder.  Something  was
moving there, and the alchemistÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s eyesÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âthe boy could see only his eyesÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â
squinted with his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in
the hole. Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm and
leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.
The  boy  leapt  as  well,  but  away  from  the  alchemist.  The  snake  fought
frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert. It was
a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in minutes.

The  boy  watched  as  his  companion  went  to  his  horse  and  withdrew  a
scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and then he placed the
snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.]]></text>

THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT. TWO HOURS BEFORE dawn, he awoke one of
the boys who slept in his tent, and asked him to show him where Fatima lived.
They went to her tent, and the boy gave his friend enough gold to buy a sheep.
Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was sleeping, and
to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside. The young Arab did as
he was asked, and was given enough gold to buy yet another sheep.

Fatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went out to do
the chores she had done for years. But everything had changed. The boy was no
longer at the oasis, and the oasis would never again have the same meaning it
had had only yesterday. It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm
trees and three hundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end
of their long journeys. From that day on, the oasis would be an empty place for
her.
From that day on, it was the desert that would be important. She would
look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the boy was following
in  search  of  his  treasure.  She  would  have  to  send  her  kisses  on  the  wind,
hoping that the wind would touch the boyÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s face, and would tell him that she
was alive. That she was waiting for him, a woman awaiting a courageous man

thing to her: the hope for his return.

The man was speaking the language of alchemy. But the boy knew that he
was referring to Fatima.
It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with
its endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy could still see the palm
trees,  the  wells,  and  the  face  of  the  woman  he  loved.  He  could  see  the
Englishman  at  his  experiments,  and  the  camel  driver  who  was  a  teacher
without  realizing  it.  Maybe  the  alchemist  has  never  been  in  love,  the  boy
thought.
The alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder. The bird knew
the language of the desert well, and whenever they stopped, he flew off in
search of game. On the first day he returned with a rabbit, and on the second
with two birds.
At night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden. The
desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and darker as the phases of
the moon passed. They went on for a week, speaking only of the precautions
they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the tribes. The war
continued,  and  at  times  the  wind  carried  the  sweet,  sickly  smell  of  blood.
Battles had been fought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was
the language of omens, always ready to show him what his eyes had failed to
observe.
On the seventh day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual.

heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to know about things
of the past or future; it was content simply to contemplate the desert, and to
drink with the boy from the Soul of the World. The boy and his heart had
become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other.
When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to
give  him  strength,  because  the  days  of  silence  there  in  the  desert  were
wearisome.  His  heart  told  the  boy  what  his  strongest  qualities  were:  his
courage in having given up his sheep and in trying to live out his Personal
Legend, and his enthusiasm during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.
And his heart told him something else that the boy had never noticed: it
told  the  boy  of  dangers  that  had  threatened  him,  but  that  he  had  never
perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden the rifle the boy had taken
from his father, because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself.

fields, after which he had fallen into a deep sleep. There had been two thieves

were surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the alchemist to see
whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared to be unaware of any danger.
Five minutes later, the boy saw two horsemen waiting ahead of them. Before
he could say anything to the alchemist, the two horsemen had become ten, and
then a hundred. And then they were everywhere in the dunes.
They were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings surrounding their
turbans.  Their  faces  were  hidden  behind  blue  veils,  with  only  their  eyes
showing.
Even from a distance, their eyes conveyed the strength of their souls. And
their eyes spoke of death.
 
THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP. A soldier shoved the boy
and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his
staff.

And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on living where survival
seemed impossible. There was the desert that he had wandered for so many

thousand palm trees and three hundred wells.

The wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was called the
sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to the east. In the distant
land the boy came from, they called it the levanter, because they believed that
it brought with it the sands of the desert, and the screams of the Moorish wars.
Perhaps, in the places beyond the pastures where his sheep lived, men thought
that the wind came from Andalusia. But, actually, the wind came from no place]]></text>

understood that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand
the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths, and to
understand what had been written on a single emerald. He saw that omens
were scattered throughout the earth and in space, and that there was no reason
or significance attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts,
nor the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created. But
that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform
miracles, or transform the sea into a desertÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦or a man into the wind. Because
only  the  hand  understood  that  it  was  a  larger  design  that  had  moved  the
universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master
Work.
The boy reached through to the Soul of the World, and saw that it was a
part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was his own soul.
And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.
 
THE SIMUM BLEW  THAT  DAY  AS  IT  HAD  NEVER  BLOWN before. For generations
thereafter, the Arabs recounted the legend of a boy who had turned himself into
the wind, almost destroying a military camp, in defiance of the most powerful
chief in the desert.
When the simum ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place where the
boy had been. But he was no longer there; he was standing next to a sand-
covered sentinel, on the far side of the camp.
The men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two people who
were smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his perfect disciple, and the
chief, because that disciple had understood the glory of God.
The following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist farewell,
and  provided  them  with  an  escort  party  to  accompany  them  as  far  as  they
chose.]]></text>

The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery. A monk dressed in
black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in the Coptic tongue, and
the alchemist bade the boy enter.

They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery. The alchemist lighted
the fire, and the monk brought him some lead, which the alchemist placed in an
iron pan. When the lead had become liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch
the strange yellow egg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it
in wax, and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.
The  mixture  took  on  a  reddish  color,  almost  the  color  of  blood.  The
alchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. As he did so,
he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.

When the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it, dazzled. The
lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no longer lead. It was gold.

told him.
But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the story of a
shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different
occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the many men who had wandered
in search of distant lands or beautiful women, confronting the people of their
times  with  their  preconceived  notions.  It  spoke  of  journeys,  discoveries,
books, and change.

The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the starry sky:
it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis. The moonlight cast
shadows  through  the  dunes,  creating  the  appearance  of  a  rolling  sea;  it
reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert, and he
had come to know the alchemist. And the moon fell on the desertÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s silence, and

When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, illuminated by
the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert, stood the solemn and
majestic Pyramids of Egypt.
The  boy  fell  to  his  knees  and  wept.  He  thanked  God  for  making  him
believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a king, a merchant,
an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all for his having met a woman of
the  desert  who  had  told  him  that  love  would  never  keep  a  man  from  his
Personal Legend.
If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to Fatima, and
live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist continued to live in]]></text>

Personal Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced
everything he might have dreamed of.
But  here  he  was,  at  the  point  of  finding  his  treasure,  and  he  reminded
himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved. The
boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that, where his tears had fallen, a
scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand. During his time in the desert, he
had learned that, in Egypt, the scarab beetles are a symbol of God.
Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, he thought
of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone could build a pyramid
in his backyard. The boy could see now that he couldnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t do so if he placed
stone upon stone for the rest of his life.
Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, but found
nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had
been built. But he didnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t stop. He struggled to continue digging as he fought the
wind, which often blew the sand back into the excavation. His hands were
abraded and exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where
his tears fell.
As  he  was  attempting  to  pull  out  the  rocks  he  encountered,  he  heard
footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were to the moonlight,
and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their faces.

THE BOY REACHED THE SMALL, ABANDONED CHURCH JUST as night was falling.
The sycamore was still there in the sacristy, and the stars could still be seen
through the half-destroyed roof. He remembered the time he had been there

Now he was here not with his flock, but with a shovel.
He sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his knapsack a
bottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the night in the desert when he

The boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his shovel hit
something  solid.  An  hour  later,  he  had  before  him  a  chest  of  Spanish  gold
coins.  There  were  also  precious  stones,  gold  masks  adorned  with  red  and
white  feathers,  and  stone  statues  embedded  with  jewels.  The  spoils  of  a
conquest that the country had long ago forgotten, and that some conquistador
had failed to tell his children about.
The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used the two
stones only once, one morning when he was at a marketplace. His life and his
path had always provided him with enough omens.
He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part of his
new treasure, because they were a reminder of the old king, whom he would]]></text>

PAULO COELHO was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the city where he now
lives.  His  own  life  has  in  many  ways  been  as  varied  and  unusual  as  the
protagonists of his internationally acclaimed novels. Like them, Paulo Coelho
has followed a dream in a quest for fulfillment. His own dream, to be a writer,
met with frustration throughout much of his early adult life, a time in which he
worked  at  various  professions,  some  of  them  materially  rewarding  but
spiritually unfulfilling.

his first book.
In 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him, he traveled through
much  of  South  America,  North  Africa,  Mexico,  and  Europe.  Returning  to
Brazil after two years, he began a successful career as popular songwriter. In
1974, he was imprisoned for a short time by the military dictatorship then ruling
in Brazil. In 1980, he experienced one of the defining moments of his life: he
walked  the  five  hundred-plus  mile  Road  of  Santiago  de  Compostela  in
northwestern Spain. On this ancient highway, used for centuries by pilgrims
from France to get to the cathedral said to house the remains of St. James, he
achieved a self-awareness and a spiritual awakening that he later described in
The Pilgrimage.
Paulo  Coelho  once  said  that  following  your  dream  is  like  learning  a
foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in the end. In
1988,  he  published  The  Alchemist,  a  novel  that  explores  this  theme,  and  it
launched him as an international bestselling author. Specifically, Paulo Coelho
is recognized for his powerful storytelling technique and the profound spiritual
insights he blends seamlessly into his parables. Since then, The Alchemist has
sold more than twenty million copies worldwide and has been translated into
some fifty-six languages. In addition to The Pilgrimage and The  Alchemist,
Paulo Coelho has written luminous novels about the different streams of our
lives, including By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, The Valkyries, The
Fifth Mountain, and Veronika Decides to Die. A winner of numerous literary
prizes, Paulo Coelho is also a prominent speaker for humanitarian causes. In
1999,  he  received  a  Crystal  Award  for  Artistic  Achievement  at  the  Davos]]></text>

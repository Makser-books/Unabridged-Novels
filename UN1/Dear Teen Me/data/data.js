Yesâ€”that	band	from	the	90â€™s	with	the	three	blondbrothers	and	the	hit	single	â€œMMMBop.â€	You	can	giggle	all	you	want,	but	theywere	Emilyâ€™s	obsession	as	a	teen.	Other	kids	picked	on	her	for	loving	them,	butshe	tried	not	to	care,	and	only	blushed	a	little	when	her	classmates	asked	aboutthe	portrait	of	Taylor	Hanson	that	she	was	working	on	that	one	day	in	art	class.Growing	up	in	Maine,	Emily	missed	out	on	the	opportunity	to	see	Hanson	live.(They	didnâ€™t	tour	up	there	until	after	sheâ€™d	moved	away.)	But	at	27,	Emily	sawthem	for	the	first	time.	All	grown	up,	they	rocked	hard	on	the	stage	at	Antoneâ€™s.It	was	such	a	rush.	On	the	way	out	the	door,	elated	to	the	point	of	slurredspeech,	Emily	knew	she	had	to	tell	her	teen	self	about	it.	So	she	did.	In	a	verylong	post	on	her	blog.For	her	part,	Miranda	would	talk	about	Star	Trek	with	anybody	who	wouldlisten	when	she	was	a	kid.	Unfortunately,	none	of	her	friends	liked	it.	Theyconsidered	Star	Trek	dorky,	and	this	destroyed	her	self-esteem.	It	wasnâ€™t	untilcollege	that	Miranda	found	other	people	who	also	loved	Star	Trek.	How	muchwould	teen	Miranda	have	loved	to	know	that	there	were	other	people	out	there	â€“great	people!	â€“	who	actually	shared	her	interests?The	internet	didnâ€™t	exist	back	thenâ€”or	at	least,	not	like	it	does	now.	Now,	kidseverywhere	can	find	friends	online	who	share	similar	interests.	(This	is	how	wefound	each	other.)	When	we	started	putting	together	Dear	Teen	Me,	we	wantedit	to	be	a	place	for	authors	to	share	experiences	with	teens,	so	that	teens	wouldknow	they	are	not	alone	and	that	they	are	cared	for,	and	that	there	are	adultswho	remember	what	itâ€™s	like	to	be	a	teen.We	began	posting	letters	on	December	1,	2010,	and	almost	immediately,	thesite	blew	up.	Or,	at	least,	we	felt	like	it	didâ€”the	response	was	beyond	ourwildest	expectations.	We	received	messages	from	so	many	authors	who	wantedto	write	letters	to	their	teen	selves,	to	give	hope	and	advice	and	direction	basedon	what	they	knew	now.	And,	even	more	importantly,	readers	were	joining	thechorus,	saying	â€œme	too!â€	and	â€œthanks	for	sharing!â€	and	â€œyou	make	me	feel	lessalone.â€	We	laughed,	we	cried,	and	we	hugged	(if	only	virtually)	every	step	ofthe	way.	In	2011,	we	met	the	incredible	folks	at	Zest	who	said,	hey,	letâ€™s	makea	book	out	of	this	thing.	This	is	that	book.This	book	is	for	you.

Anyway,	thatâ€™s	what	the	other	journalâ€™s	for:	sharing	fun	stuff	withfriends	and	illustrating,	on	a	frame-by-frame	basis,	our	delusions	of	grandeur.You	have	a	bedtime	diary	ritual,	too.	At	night	you	crawl	under	the	covers,	pullout	one	of	your	metallic	Gelly	Roll	pens,	and	woefully	scribble	into	the	samepages	that	you	filled	with	hope	that	very	morning.	It	goes	like	this:I	didnâ€™t	talk	to	John	today.	[Insert	explanation	here.]	I	donâ€™t	know	whatâ€™swrong	with	me.	I	just	know	that	thereâ€™s	something	between	us.	Thereâ€™s	areason	he	transferred	into	school	when	he	did.	And	he	told	Dad	[insertanecdote	here].	Why	canâ€™t	I	just	talk	to	him?	Iâ€™m	going	to	regret	it	if	Idonâ€™t.	This	shouldnâ€™t	be	so	hard.	But	it	is.Tomorrow	Iâ€™m	going	to	talk	to	John	Oâ€™Bleary.And	so	it	goes,	time	and	time	againâ€¦until:	You	know	that	dance	thatâ€™s	comingup?	The	Sadie	Hawkins	dance,	where	girls	are	supposed	to	ask	the	boys?	(As	ifyou	havenâ€™t	asked	your	date	to	every	other	dance,	you	inadvertent	feminist,you.)	Well,	youâ€™re	going	to	go	up	to	John	and	ask	him	to	go	to	the	dance	withyou.	Flat	out.	And	heâ€™s	going	to	say	that	someone	else	just	asked	himâ€”itâ€™s	agirl	youâ€™re	kind	of	friends	with,	and	one	of	the	only	popular	girls	whoâ€™s	neverpicked	on	you.	So	you	canâ€™t	even	hate	her.	Worse	still,	John	is	so	freaking	nicethat	he	asks	you	to	save	him	a	dance.You	never	do	get	that	dance.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	you	werenâ€™t	supposed	to.I	was	home	for	Christmas	in	2010,	sitting	on	the	sofa	at	Niniâ€™s	house	(yes,	westill	call	our	grandmother	Nini),	when	she	announced	that	John	Oâ€™Bleary	wasmarrying	that	very	same	girl	who	asked	him	to	the	dance	not	half	an	hourbefore	you	did.	And	in	that	moment,	I	couldnâ€™t	help	wondering	what	it	wouldhave	been	like	to	be	Mrs.	Oâ€™Bleary.Teen	Me,	donâ€™t	let	this	crush	you.	As	I	write	this	today,	I	canâ€™t	help	but	feellucky	that	Iâ€™m	not	Mrs.	Oâ€™Bleary.

You	wrote	inyour	secret	journal	that	you	didnâ€™t	want	to	be	thirty	and	look	back	with	regrets.You	were	sure	that	if	you	didnâ€™t	ask	John	out,	you	would	always	wonder,â€œWhat	if?â€	Iâ€™m	almost	thirty	now,	and	thanks	to	you,	I	have	no	what-ifs.	So,asking	John	out?	Yeah,	I	think	we	can	say	with	certainty	that	it	was	a	good	idea.(Even	though	the	journal	entry	from	that	evening	says	something	like:	Well,]]></text>  </page>  <page pageNumber = "8">     <text><![CDATA[stamp	an	R	on	my	forehead	and	throw	me	in	the	Reject	bin!)Youâ€™re	not	a	reject,	Teen	Me.

Yes,	youâ€™ve	been	crazybusy,	but	this	is	inexcusable.	The	betrayal	makes	you	feel	even	more	exhausted.Before	crawling	into	bed,	you	thought	about	calling	someone	to	confide	in,	butwho	would	you	call?

Youâ€™re	nervous	and	exhilarated	and	you	wonder	if	youâ€™re	crazybecause	getting	this	right	means	so	much	to	you;	you	feel	every	note	so	deeply.The	song	sounds	plaintive,	sinister,	and	sexy	all	at	the	same	time.

Different	rocker,	same	edge.You	are	firmly	convinced	you	have	no	edge.	Though	itâ€™s	hard	to	believe	here	inthe	future,	youâ€™re	still	very	shy	right	now.	You	donâ€™t	tell	anyone	how	deeplythat	song	moves	you,	especially	since	youâ€™re	not	totally	sure	what	itâ€™s	all	about.But	when	you	listen	to	it,	you	feel	as	if	thereâ€™s	a	world	living	and	breathinginside	the	music.	It	seems	like,	in	a	way,	the	Stones	live	there,	and	that	if	youget	the	dancers	to	feel	as	much	as	youâ€™re	feeling	through	the	movements	yougive	them,	the	Jaggerverse	will	shimmer	into	existence,	and	youâ€™ll	suddenlyfind	yourself	living	a	Bohemian	existence	downtown.Grossmont	is	your	third	high	school.	No	one	there	knows	that	less	than	a	yearago,	you	dropped	out	of	your	second	high	school	and	moved	to	Europe	tobecome	a	classical	ballet	dancerâ€”and	that	you	came	home	six	weeks	laterbecause	your	father	died	of	a	heart	attack.	When	it	happened	your	stepmothergot	you	a	ticket	homeâ€”for	the	funeral,	you	thought.	You	fully	expected	toreturn	to	Europe	to	keep	dancing,	but	your	stepmother	talked	you	into	staying	inCalifornia	and	finishing	high	school.	Which	seemed	like	the	sensible	thing	todo	at	the	time.	But	later	on	you	find	out	that	Mrs.	Newman,	your	stateside	balletteacher,	didnâ€™t	think	it	was	such	a	good	idea.	She	felt	like	youâ€™d	lose	yourchance	to	become	really	good.

Most	dancing	careers	end	by	the	time	thedancers	reach	their	mid-thirties.Your	stepmother	moved	your	family	to	La	Mesa,	where	you	went	toGrossmont,	and	thatâ€™s	where	you	are	when	this	picture	is	taken.	Youâ€™ve	found	agreat	studio,	where	you	take	every	class	you	can,	starting	with	the	baby	classand	ending	at	nine	at	night.	You	come	home	from	hours	of	practice	soexhausted	that	you	step	into	the	shower	in	your	leotard	and	tights,	lean	againstthe	tile,	and	fall	asleep.	You	stretch	your	legs	over	your	head	and	hook	yourtoes	under	the	lip	of	your	headboard	and	lie	like	that	for	hours.And	you	keep	listening,	endlessly,	to	â€œLady	Jane,â€	choreographing	it	in	yourhead.	And	one	day,	your	stepmother	sees	tears	streaming	down	your	face,	andasks	you	why	youâ€™re	crying.â€œItâ€™s	the	music.	Itâ€™s	so	beautiful,â€	you	say.She	gives	you	a	classic	what	the	hell?	stare.	What	you	have	said	is	notcomputing	in	her	mind.â€œIf	it	makes	you	cry,â€	she	asks,	â€œwhy	do	you	listen	to	it?â€Sheâ€™s	genuinely	bewildered,	and	you	wonder	if	itâ€™s	weird	to	cry	when	listeningto	beautiful	music.	You	try	to	remember	if	anyone	in	ballet	school	in	Germanycried	like	that.	But	in	Germany,	you	guys	were	completely	focused	on	yourtraining,	and	afterward,	those	crazy	kids	spoke	to	each	other	in	a	language	thatwas	not	English.	You,	being	a	Californian,	opted	for	Spanish	as	your	WorldLanguage	(that	is,	before	you	dropped	out	of	school).	So	as	far	as	you	know,	noone	in	your	Balletthochschule	ever	sobbed	along	to	Brian	Jonesâ€™s	dulcimertrack.In	this	time	of	uncertainty,	your	stepmother	adds	that	dancers	never	make	anymoney	and	they	get	injured	all	the	time.	She	says	that	when	the	injuries	are	badenough	they	end	up	teaching	classes	at	the	YMCA.And	so,	in	this	picture	of	you	at	the	gym,	you	are,	frankly,	falling	apart.	Youâ€™reworried	about	getting	injured	and	winding	up	at	the	YMCA	(where	you	alreadyhave	a	job	for	the	summer).	Youâ€™re	stressing	that	you	and	your	dancers	wonâ€™tbe	able	to	dance	the	Jaggerverse	into	reality,	and	youâ€™re	worried	that	worryingabout	it	means	youâ€™re	psycho.

He	tells	you	aboutthis	â€œprojectâ€	he	did	where	he	danced	around	for	a	while	wearing	a	raincoat,then	climbed	into	a	barrel	while	another	dancer	poured	gallons	of	milk	over	hishead	and	then	added	several	boxes	of	cornflakes.	You	think	this	is	a	little	bitrandom	(okay,	a	lot),	but	the	fact	that	he	could	even	come	up	with	somethinglike	this	and,	moreover,	get	the	school	to	let	him	do	it	sends	you	soaring.Plus,	he	partners	you	in	classical	ballet	at	the	studio.	Youâ€™ve	never	gotten	todance	with	a	guy	before,	and	it	turns	out	that	you	totally	light	up	the	room	whenyou	leap	into	his	arms	and	do	a	fish	dive	(sorry,	thatâ€™s	the	technical	term)	andthen,	after	class,	you	two	drive	to	Balboa	Park	and	make	out	in	the	OrganPavilion.	(The	unfortunate	double	entendre	doesnâ€™t	register	at	the	time.)	Andyour	ballet	teacher	(Russian,	strict,	and,	apparently,	very	romantic)	tells	youthat	you	should	marry	this	boy.Which	would	be	another	way	of	dropping	out	of	high	school;	but	your	man-dancer	is	not	asking	and,	in	fact,	he	leaves	after	a	while	because	heâ€™stransferring	to	a	new	college.So	now	youâ€™re	losing	the	Cornflake	King	of	the	dance	world,	the	only	personyouâ€™ve	ever	told	about	your	attempt	to	conjure	the	Jaggerverse	into	reality	withsmokinâ€™	choreography.	And	your	heart	aches	when	he	makes	his	dramatic	exitlike	someone	in	The	Black	Swan.	Youâ€™ve	always	known	in	the	back	of	yourmind	that	heâ€™s	older	and	that	because	youâ€™re	so	angsty	and	conflicted,	you	feellike	you	canâ€™t	hold	your	own	against	a	mature	dancer	like	him.	(Even	if	he	isjust	a	modern	dancer.)So	here	you	are	in	the	picture,	your	blood	practically	curdling	with	anxiety,	andwhatever	I	say	to	you	right	now	will	probably	sound	like	a	lecture.

Comedian	Bob	Hopelived	next	door	and,	having	adopted	a	slew	of	kids	himself,	he	sent	his	nannyover	to	help	out	for	a	few	days.	You	were,	of	course,	much	too	young	toappreciate	this.	But	letâ€™s	just	say	that	few	enough	people	are	given	such	anauspicious	beginning.The	truth	is,	you	were	a	child	of	privilege.	Not	so	much	because	of	money(though	you	never	went	without),	but	because	of	a	very	large	measure	of	loveinfusing	your	childhood.	You	were	doted	on,	and	while	your	parentsâ€™	agedenied	activities	some	families	sharedâ€”skiing	or	mountain	biking,	for	instanceâ€”your	mom	and	dad	rewarded	you	with	things	many	children	never	have.

You	stashed	that	away,	in	a	cabinet	deep	inside	you,and	there	it	will	stay	into	adulthood.Elementary	school	was	your	â€œchubbyâ€	phase.

She	doesnâ€™t	have	a	destination.	Sheâ€™s	just	bored	and	wants	to	hang	out.Hereâ€™s	my	first	bit	of	advice:	Go.Around	2:00	am,	your	friend	will	take	the	highway	back	into	town.	The	roadstretches	on	for	twenty	miles,	but	you	know	that	somewhere	on	that	road	yourcousin	owns	a	house.	To	pass	the	time,	you	look	for	his	vehicle	in	the	slide	ofheadlights.

Please.â€You	rush	down	the	hallway.	Shake	your	mom	awake.	Hand	her	the	phone.	Youstep	back	and	wait.	Wait.	And	wait.	Itâ€™ll	only	be	a	few	seconds,	but	itâ€™ll	seemlike	forever.Just	when	you	think	you	canâ€™t	stand	it	any	longer,	your	mom	will	let	out	achoked	sob	and	somehow	youâ€™ll	know	this	is	connected	to	the	cop	car,	to	theambulance.

Call	your	friend	Wes.	Call	him.	Heâ€™ll	help	you	escape.At	dinnertime,	youâ€™ll	realize	you	havenâ€™t	eaten	all	day.	At	the	fast-food	place,Wes	will	know	the	boy	behind	the	counter.	You	wonâ€™t	catch	his	name.	Heâ€™llgive	you	extra	fries.	On	a	day	like	this,	the	fries	mean	more	than	they	normallywould.Remember	him.	Itâ€™ll	be	a	hazy	memory,	but	keep	it	tucked	away.Three	months	later,	a	boy	will	come	into	the	Laundromat	where	you	work.Heâ€™ll	ask	you	out.

Fate	may	seem	a	silly	notion,	but	sometimes,tiny,	inconspicuous	moments	will	connect	to	something	bigger,	somethingprofound.	So	my	last	bit	of	advice	is	this:	Take	nothing	for	granted.

I	should	dothat,	shouldnâ€™t	I?	It	would	be	really	nice	of	me	to	help	you	be	a	more	welladjusted	person.The	trouble	with	that	is,	when	I	think	of	advice	I	could	give	you,	I	mostly	comeup	with	things	for	you	not	to	do.For	example,	when	the	boy	youâ€™ve	had	a	crush	on	for	two	years	rests	his	elbowon	your	shoulder,	do	not	respond	by	saying,	â€œArenâ€™t	you	a	little	short	for	that?â€Yes,	that	will	remove	his	arm,	but	it	will	also	remove	any	chance	you	mighthave	had	of	going	out	with	him.Do	not	write	long	letters	to	every	girl	in	your	bunk	at	camp,	or	to	every	memberof	your	graduating	class,	in	which	you	explain	to	them	how	much	you	careabout	them	and	explain	how	they	can	still	improve	themselves.	This	is	weird,and	nobody	will	appreciate	it.	You	are	actually	not	an	expert	on	other	peopleâ€™scharacter	flaws.	Furthermore,	writing	fifty	letters	is	a	huge	time	investment,	andyou	could	probably	spend	those	hours	doing	something	more	useful,	likelearning	how	to	cook	(which	you	still	do	not	know	how	to	do,	sorry).Do	not	go	on	a	self-loathing	spree	after	you	get	rejected	from	your	four	top-choice	colleges.	Itâ€™s	not	because	youâ€™re	worthless	and	unappreciated;	itâ€™sbecause	getting	into	college	is	hard.Do	not	pull	out	in	front	of	that	school	bus	when	thereâ€™s	a	police	car	directlybehind	you.	Thatâ€™s	a	one-hundred-dollar	ticket,	Teen	Me.	You	could	use	thathundred	dollars,	if	you	still	had	it	today.	You	could	buy	yourself	a	new	iPod.(Teen	Me,	iPods	are	this	amazing	technology	that	let	you	carry	aroundthousands	of	songs	instead	of	just	a	few	CDs.	I	mean	it.

You	make	a	lot	of	mistakes	as	a	teenager,	itâ€™s	true,	andyou	make	some	enemies	as	well.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	I	donâ€™t	actually	want	youto	avoid	those	mistakes.	Because	then	you	would	have	nothing	to	write	about.Even	if	I	could	instruct	you	on	how	to	get	through	high	school	withoutoffending	a	single	one	of	your	classmates,	without	scaring	off	a	single	boy,without	angering	any	of	your	teachersâ€”even	then,	I	wouldnâ€™t	do	it.	Becauseeach	time	you	ate	lunch	alone	in	the	library	or	totally	botched	a	stage	kiss,	youwere	giving	yourself	the	materials	you	now	need	as	a	novelist.Eventually	every	one	of	your	missteps,	and	every	person	who	wouldnâ€™t	giveyou	the	time	of	day,	will	make	their	way	into	your	books.	And	teenagers	allover	the	world	will	read	those	books,	and	some	will	even	say	things	like,	â€œIlove	this	book.	Leila	Sales	seems	really	cool.â€	Iâ€™m	serious.	If	you	give	itenough	time,	teenagers	will	think	you	are	cool.	It	wonâ€™t	be	while	youâ€™re	ateenager,	but	still.So	do	exactly	what	youâ€™re	doing.	Make	every	mistake	youâ€™re	making,	but	alsolearn	from	them,	remember	them,	and	use	them.Two	exceptions	to	that	advice:Do	not	be	so	bitchy	to	your	dad.And	do	not	blow-dry	the	life	out	of	your	hair	every	day.	Your	hair	is	curly,	andit	looks	good	curly.	Forcing	it	to	be	something	that	itâ€™s	not	isnâ€™t	foolinganybody.Other	than	those	two	things,	just	carry	on	as	you	were.

Life	is	slippery	that	way,	so	letâ€™sbreak	down	some	of	your	core	beliefs:Youâ€™ll	never	get	over	your	first	love.Why	youâ€™re	right:	Heâ€™s	pretty	awesome.

Thereâ€™s	no	getting	over	a	first	love.Thereâ€™s	only	holding	the	memory	of	it	close	and	making	it	a	part	of	the	fabric	ofthe	rest	of	your	life.Why	youâ€™re	wrong:	Breaking	up	with	him	will	not	mean	leaving	yourselfdamaged	in	an	irreparable	way.

The	nature	of	friendship	changes	as	youmove	toward	adulthood.Childhood	friendships	were	often	based	on	proximity,	what	you	like	to	do	forfun,	how	your	moms	feel	about	each	other.	Donâ€™t	get	me	wrongâ€”a	couple	ofthose	childhood	friendships	were	great,	memorable,	so	much	fun,	and	soimportant.	Rachel,	for	example.	And	of	course	Christine,	who	youâ€™ll	still	be	intouch	with	when	youâ€™re	fortyâ€”and	even	though	you	arenâ€™t	best,	best	friendslike	you	were	in	childhood,	it	feels	so	good	to	still	be	known	by	someone	whoknew	you	when	you	were	four.As	you	get	older,	what	youâ€™re	really	looking	for	is	someone	who	understandsyou,	with	whom	you	feel	a	flash	of	recognition	and	a	sense	of	home.	And	Sara?Iâ€™m	going	to	tell	you	this,	and	itâ€™s	not	a	criticism:	You	are	not	a	person	who	iseasily	understoodâ€”by	yourself	or	by	others.	But	being	understood	mattersenough	to	you	that	youâ€™ll	go	through	a	lot	of	pain	and	work	to	know	yourself,and	youâ€™ll	make	some	missteps	in	your	efforts	to	be	known	by	others.Iâ€™m	not	going	to	tell	you	about	those	missteps,	though,	or	warn	you	againstthem.	Each	misstep	shows	you	something	about	yourself	that	you	needed	toknow,	and	refines	your	vision	of	what	you	want	in	a	friend,	which	brings	youcloser	to	finding	those	people,	that	person.As	for	what	makes	a	friend,	thereâ€™s	no	ultimate	definition.

There	are	friends	that	are	perfect	for	eating	lunch	with,friends	you	meet	in	a	mutual	endeavorâ€”like	at	work	or	in	theater	or	musicâ€”friends	to	party	and	play	with,	friends	who	are	good	companions	on	road	trips.The	longevity	of	these	types	of	friendships	tends	to	be	limited	by	their	context,but	thereâ€™s	no	shame	or	failure	in	that.If	there	is	any	definition	of	a	True	Friend,	maybe	itâ€™s	this:	a	person	whounderstands	the	kind	of	person	you	want	to	be,	and	whose	words	and	actionstoward	you	are	always	guided	by	that	understanding.I	do	want	to	tell	you	what	a	friend	isnâ€™t,	though	I	know	youâ€™re	going	to	have	todo	the	work	of	figuring	this	out	on	your	own:	A	friend	isnâ€™t	a	person	whoseattention	and	approval	you	depend	on	to	feel	okay	about	yourself.This	is	a	hard	one	to	work	out.

Even	if	everyone	in	the	world	tells	you	thatyouâ€™re	okay	(and	you	are	going	to	have	a	great	career	that	earns	you	a	lot	ofattention	and	approval),	sometimes	itâ€™s	not	going	to	feel	like	enough.This	is	going	to	lead	to	pain.I	sort	of	wish	I	could	save	you	from	that	pain,	but	to	paraphrase	C.	S.	Lewis,	thepain	now	is	part	of	the	joy	later.	And	thereâ€™s	going	to	be	joy,	too,	in	the	verymidst	of	pain,	because	you	are	going	to	be	blessed	with	a	number	of	verymeaningful	friendshipsâ€”some	of	which	began	from	that	place	of	needingapproval	but	then	grew	beyond	that	and	became	real.However,	not	all	of	them	are	lasting,	and	even	though	youâ€™ll	think	youâ€™re	goingto	die	when	some	of	those	friendships	come	to	an	end,	you	wonâ€™t.	Youâ€™ll	comeout	alive,	stronger,	better	for	the	years	that	you	had	together,	full	of	self-knowledge	you	wouldnâ€™t	have	discovered	any	other	way.

Thefirst	thing	I	thought	when	I	saw	him	was	â€œpoor	guy.â€	The	doctor	told	me	Imight	not	get	a	single	room.	Damn	it.	I	started	crying.	In	the	end	though,	I	gotmy	own	room,	but	it	was	small	and	run-down.	How	would	I	manage	to	staythere	for	so	long?	I	wondered.	We	asked	the	doctor	if	I	could	be	placed	in	thechildren&apos;s	unit.	At	first,	he	said	no,	but	we	kept	at	it,	and	the	third	time	he	saidhe&apos;d	try	to	arrange	it.	It	worked.	Third	time&apos;s	a	charm.After	a	while	I	was	moved	to	the	children&apos;s	unit.	They	told	us	the	cutoff	agewas	eighteen.	So	then	why	the	hell	was	I	put	in	the	adult	unit	in	the	first	place?I	get	irritated	just	thinking	about	it.	I&apos;m	glad	I&apos;m	not	eighteen.The	children&apos;s	unit	was	much	betterâ€”renovated	and	a	lot	larger.	The	roomswere	big	and	had	flatscreen	TVs.	There	was	even	space	for	my	family.	Mymood	got	way	better,	even	though	I	still	felt	really	sick.On	Friday,	August	29,	Regine&apos;s	mother,	Julianne,	wrote	in	her	diary:We&apos;re	now	at	Day	5	in	the	Trondheim	hospital,	and	it&apos;s	been	exactly	one	weeksince	we	found	out	that	Regine	had	acute	leukemia.	Who	could	have	possiblyseen	this	coming?	In	the	blink	of	an	eye	we	went	from	being	blissfully	unawareto	being	devastated	by	desperation,	pain,	and	a	sense	of	injustice.	Why	wouldthis	happen	to	our	dearest	possessionâ€”our	lovely,	intelligent	daughter,	who&apos;snever	hurt	anyone?	Everything	I&apos;ve	ever	seen	from	her	shows	that	she&apos;s	a	goodperson	through	and	through.	Still,	it&apos;s	happening;	it	seems	unreal.	Can	thisactually	be	happening?

Some	of	the	content	will	therefore	be	too	heavy	for	somepeople.The	whole	thing	started	on	Friday,	August	22Ihad	just	come	home	from	school	and	didn&apos;t	have	a	care	in	the	world.	ThenMom	walked	in,	and	right	away	I	realized	something	was	wrong.	She	hadtears	in	her	eyes.	The	doctor	had	called,	and	they	suspected	leukemia.	I	had	togo	to	the	hospital	as	soon	as	possible	for	a	bone	marrow	biopsy.1Right	away	I	felt	like	my	life	had	been	shattered.	I	was	crying	my	eyes	out.	Ihad	a	million	conflicting	emotions,	but	more	than	anything	else,	I	was	scared.At	the	hospital	in	Kristiansund	they	started	right	out	with	the	tests.	Thebiopsy	wasn&apos;t	pleasant	at	allâ€”I	was	shocked	at	how	painful	it	was.	And	then	Ihad	to	wait	three	hours	for	the	results.	I	sat	around	at	the	hospital	with	Momand	Dad	until	the	doctor	came	in.	We	were	nervous	and	scared.	He	had	tears	inhis	eyes:	I	had	leukemia,	more	specifically	AML	(acute	myelogenousleukemia2).	I	could	feel	the	fear	spreading	all	through	my	body	when	he	saidthat.	Cancer.	The	whole	family	was	crushed.	I	couldn&apos;t	stop	asking	myself:	Isthis	a	death	sentence?On	Monday,	August	25,	we	drove	to	Trondheim.	That&apos;s	where	I	had	to	go	fortreatment.I	was	referred	to	the	adult	unit,	where	I	had	to	take	another	bone	marrowbiopsy.	This	time	it	was	going	to	be	even	more	extensive	than	what	they&apos;d	donebefore.	In	this	kind	of	a	biopsy,	they	have	to	drill	out	a	bit	of	bone,	and	it&apos;sincredibly	painful.	I	could	feel	my	whole	body	jerk	when	the	doctor	yanked	thepiece	out.After	that	they	showed	us	around	the	unit.	It	was	like	going	down	into	hell.]]></text>  </page></eBook>';

     <text><![CDATA[Dear	Readers,
It	started	with	Hanson.	Yesâ€”that	band	from	the	90â€™s	with	the	three	blond
brothers	and	the	hit	single	â€œMMMBop.â€	You	can	giggle	all	you	want,	but	they
were	Emilyâ€™s	obsession	as	a	teen.	Other	kids	picked	on	her	for	loving	them,	but
she	tried	not	to	care,	and	only	blushed	a	little	when	her	classmates	asked	about
the	portrait	of	Taylor	Hanson	that	she	was	working	on	that	one	day	in	art	class.
Growing	up	in	Maine,	Emily	missed	out	on	the	opportunity	to	see	Hanson	live.
(They	didnâ€™t	tour	up	there	until	after	sheâ€™d	moved	away.)	But	at	27,	Emily	saw
them	for	the	first	time.	All	grown	up,	they	rocked	hard	on	the	stage	at	Antoneâ€™s.
It	was	such	a	rush.	On	the	way	out	the	door,	elated	to	the	point	of	slurred
speech,	Emily	knew	she	had	to	tell	her	teen	self	about	it.	So	she	did.	In	a	very
long	post	on	her	blog.
For	her	part,	Miranda	would	talk	about	Star	Trek	with	anybody	who	would
listen	when	she	was	a	kid.	Unfortunately,	none	of	her	friends	liked	it.	They
considered	Star	Trek	dorky,	and	this	destroyed	her	self-esteem.	It	wasnâ€™t	until
college	that	Miranda	found	other	people	who	also	loved	Star	Trek.	How	much
would	teen	Miranda	have	loved	to	know	that	there	were	other	people	out	there	â€“
great	people!	â€“	who	actually	shared	her	interests?
The	internet	didnâ€™t	exist	back	thenâ€”or	at	least,	not	like	it	does	now.	Now,	kids
everywhere	can	find	friends	online	who	share	similar	interests.	(This	is	how	we
found	each	other.)	When	we	started	putting	together	Dear	Teen	Me,	we	wanted
it	to	be	a	place	for	authors	to	share	experiences	with	teens,	so	that	teens	would
know	they	are	not	alone	and	that	they	are	cared	for,	and	that	there	are	adults
who	remember	what	itâ€™s	like	to	be	a	teen.
We	began	posting	letters	on	December	1,	2010,	and	almost	immediately,	the
site	blew	up.	Or,	at	least,	we	felt	like	it	didâ€”the	response	was	beyond	our
wildest	expectations.	We	received	messages	from	so	many	authors	who	wanted
to	write	letters	to	their	teen	selves,	to	give	hope	and	advice	and	direction	based
on	what	they	knew	now.	And,	even	more	importantly,	readers	were	joining	the
chorus,	saying	â€œme	too!â€	and	â€œthanks	for	sharing!â€	and	â€œyou	make	me	feel	less
alone.â€	We	laughed,	we	cried,	and	we	hugged	(if	only	virtually)	every	step	of
the	way.	In	2011,	we	met	the	incredible	folks	at	Zest	who	said,	hey,	letâ€™s	make
a	book	out	of	this	thing.	This	is	that	book.
This	book	is	for	you.	For	the	loners,	the	stoners,	the	freaks	and	the	geeks,	the
head	cheerleaders	and	the	kids	eating	lunch	in	the	library,	the	starting	lineup,
the	benchwarmers,	the	glee	club,	and	the	marching	band.	This	book	is	for]]></text>

E.	Kristin	Anderson
Dear	Teen	Me,
We	spend	most	mornings	writing	in	our	diary.	Not	the	fun	diary	that	you	share
with	friends.	Not	the	one	where	you	draw	pictures	of	Hanson	and	Foo	Fighters
and	analyze	the	Grammys.	Iâ€™m	talking	about	the	one	where	you	write	about
how	scared	you	are	that	weâ€™ll	never	find	THE	ONE,	and	about	how	fighting
with	your	mom	is	wearing	you	out,	and	how	youâ€™re	grossed	out	by	sex,	and
how	desperately,	how	insanely	you	want	to	date	John	Oâ€™Bleary*.
You	barely	know	John	Oâ€™Bleary.	He	transferred	to	your	school	during
sophomore	year,	and	now	heâ€™s	the	goalie	for	the	hockey	team.	The	team	your
brother	plays	for.	The	team	your	dad	coaches.	And,	yes,	your	dad	actually	told
his	players	that	if	they	tried	to	date	you	theyâ€™d	be	â€œriding	the	pine	ponyâ€
indefinitely.
But	Dad	would	have	made	an	exception	for	John.	Heâ€™s	different	from	the	other
hockey	guys.	And	sometimes	he	and	Dad	talk	about	you	on	the	team	bus.	So
now	youâ€™re	convinced	that	you	and	John	Oâ€™Bleary	are	going	to	ride	off	into	the
sunset	in	whatever	car	he	drives	(like	I	said,	you	barely	know	him)	and	get
married	and	have	adorable	Oâ€™Bleary	babies.
So	just	about	every	entry	in	your	journal	is	about	John	Oâ€™Bleary.	I	mean,	youâ€™re
probably	writing	about	him	right	now,	as	the	sun	finishes	coming	up.	I	bet
thereâ€™s	a	cup	of	Raspberry	Zinger	herbal	tea	cooling	on	your	nightstand	next	to
a	half-eaten	bagel	slathered	in	cream	cheese.	You	have	a	whole	routine:	wake
up,	shower,	make	breakfast,	crawl	back	into	bed	(with	your	breakfast),	and
write	in	your	diary.	Donâ€™t	even	try	to	deny	it.	Youâ€™re	about	to	start	another
entry	about	how	today	is	the	day	youâ€™re	going	to	talk	to	John.
In	fact,	there	are	eleventy	billion	entries	of	pure	Oâ€™Bleary	pining.	I	could
transcribe	a	page	word	for	word,	but	Iâ€™d	hate	to	betray	your	confidence.	After
all,	we	swore	to	ourselves	we	would	never	share	THAT	journal	with	anyone;
we	fear	the	damage	its	publication	could	wreak	upon	our	impending	fame.	(We
donâ€™t	want	our	adoring	public	to	know	that	weâ€™re	so	shallow	we	only	ever	write]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[about	boys.)	Anyway,	thatâ€™s	what	the	other	journalâ€™s	for:	sharing	fun	stuff	with
friends	and	illustrating,	on	a	frame-by-frame	basis,	our	delusions	of	grandeur.
You	have	a	bedtime	diary	ritual,	too.	At	night	you	crawl	under	the	covers,	pull
out	one	of	your	metallic	Gelly	Roll	pens,	and	woefully	scribble	into	the	same
pages	that	you	filled	with	hope	that	very	morning.	It	goes	like	this:
I	didnâ€™t	talk	to	John	today.	[Insert	explanation	here.]	I	donâ€™t	know	whatâ€™s
wrong	with	me.	I	just	know	that	thereâ€™s	something	between	us.	Thereâ€™s	a
reason	he	transferred	into	school	when	he	did.	And	he	told	Dad	[insert
anecdote	here].	Why	canâ€™t	I	just	talk	to	him?	Iâ€™m	going	to	regret	it	if	I
donâ€™t.	This	shouldnâ€™t	be	so	hard.	But	it	is.
Tomorrow	Iâ€™m	going	to	talk	to	John	Oâ€™Bleary.
And	so	it	goes,	time	and	time	againâ€¦until:	You	know	that	dance	thatâ€™s	coming
up?	The	Sadie	Hawkins	dance,	where	girls	are	supposed	to	ask	the	boys?	(As	if
you	havenâ€™t	asked	your	date	to	every	other	dance,	you	inadvertent	feminist,
you.)	Well,	youâ€™re	going	to	go	up	to	John	and	ask	him	to	go	to	the	dance	with
you.	Flat	out.	And	heâ€™s	going	to	say	that	someone	else	just	asked	himâ€”itâ€™s	a
girl	youâ€™re	kind	of	friends	with,	and	one	of	the	only	popular	girls	whoâ€™s	never
picked	on	you.	So	you	canâ€™t	even	hate	her.	Worse	still,	John	is	so	freaking	nice
that	he	asks	you	to	save	him	a	dance.
You	never	do	get	that	dance.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	you	werenâ€™t	supposed	to.
I	was	home	for	Christmas	in	2010,	sitting	on	the	sofa	at	Niniâ€™s	house	(yes,	we
still	call	our	grandmother	Nini),	when	she	announced	that	John	Oâ€™Bleary	was
marrying	that	very	same	girl	who	asked	him	to	the	dance	not	half	an	hour
before	you	did.	And	in	that	moment,	I	couldnâ€™t	help	wondering	what	it	would
have	been	like	to	be	Mrs.	Oâ€™Bleary.
Teen	Me,	donâ€™t	let	this	crush	you.	As	I	write	this	today,	I	canâ€™t	help	but	feel
lucky	that	Iâ€™m	not	Mrs.	Oâ€™Bleary.	Iâ€™m	in	love	right	now	with	someone	else
entirely,	hundreds	of	miles	from	chez	Oâ€™Bleary
But	even	knowing	that,	I	still	want	you	to	ask	John	to	that	dance.	You	wrote	in
your	secret	journal	that	you	didnâ€™t	want	to	be	thirty	and	look	back	with	regrets.
You	were	sure	that	if	you	didnâ€™t	ask	John	out,	you	would	always	wonder,
â€œWhat	if?â€	Iâ€™m	almost	thirty	now,	and	thanks	to	you,	I	have	no	what-ifs.	So,
asking	John	out?	Yeah,	I	think	we	can	say	with	certainty	that	it	was	a	good	idea.
(Even	though	the	journal	entry	from	that	evening	says	something	like:	Well,]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[stamp	an	R	on	my	forehead	and	throw	me	in	the	Reject	bin!)
Youâ€™re	not	a	reject,	Teen	Me.	Youâ€™re	brave.	When	you	think	back	on	that
moment	later	on,	youâ€™ll	feel	pride,	more	than	anything	else:	pride,	because
youâ€™re	the	kind	of	girl	who	has	the	cojones	to	ask	for	what	she	wants.
Youâ€™re	setting	a	high	standard	for	yourself	as	an	adult.	For	me.	You	already
know	what	you	want	and	you	ask	for	it	without	hesitation.	Okay,	maybe	with	a
little	hesitationâ€”the	journal	proves	thatâ€”but	I	love	that	you	dare	not	only	to
dream,	but	to	believe	in	those	dreams,	whatever	the	cost.	I	mean,	it	will	be
about	three	years	before	you	realize	that	youâ€™re	not	going	to	be	a	rock	star	in
this	lifetime,	but	youâ€™re	never,	ever	going	to	be	afraid	to	(poorly)	sing	karaoke.
And	sure,	youâ€™re	not	poet	laureate	(yet),	but	youâ€™re	going	to	publish	a	lot	of
great	poems	in	actual	magazines	because	you	will	actually	put	those	poems	in
the	mail	and	send	them	out	into	the	world.	And	no	matter	how	many	times	you
get	your	heart	broken,	youâ€™ll	keep	on	believing	in	love.
Asking	John	Oâ€™Bleary	to	the	Sadie	Hawkins	dance	was	about	so	much	more
than	getting	rejected	by	the	boy	of	your	dreams;	it	was	about	setting	the	pace
for	the	rest	of	your	life.	You	already	believe	in	something	Faith	will	say	on
Buffy	the	Vampire	Slayer:	â€œWant,	take,	have!â€	And	while	youâ€™re	not	going	to
use	this	for	evil	quite	the	way	she	did,	youâ€™re	going	to	wear	your	heart	on	your
sleeve	and	pursue	impossible	goals	and	take	inadvisable	risks.	Because	itâ€™s	the
only	way	you	know	how	to	be	you.
But	I	think	youâ€™ve	already	got	a	sense	of	thisâ€”even	on	bad	days,	when	you	feel
like	you	have	eighty	Râ€™s	on	your	forehead	(like	the	day	when	you	realize	that,
whoa,	thereâ€™s	no	cure	for	bipolar	disorder;	or	all	the	times	when	you	want	to
hide	until	school,	and	your	parents,	and	the	mean	girls	disappear).	Pretty	soon
youâ€™re	going	to	realize	that	â€œIt	works	if	you	work	itâ€	is	more	than	a	Taylor
Hawkins	quote	(from	that	new	magazine	Nylon).	â€œIt	works	if	you	work	itâ€	are
words	to	live	by,	and	youâ€™re	already	on	top	of	it.	So	donâ€™t	change	a	damn	thing.

     <text><![CDATA[CONTENTS	UNDER	PRESSURE
Jessica	Lee	Anderson
Dear	Teen	Me,
Itâ€™s	your	senior	year	of	high	school,	8:00	p.m.	on	a	Friday	night.	Thereâ€™s	a	huge
football	game	happening	right	now	and	parties	are	just	getting	started.	Sadly,
youâ€™re	in	bed.	Not	because	you	have	some	illness	or	because	youâ€™re	nursing	a
hangover	or	anything	like	that	(though	be	warned:	you	will	soon	suffer	the
worst	hangover	of	your	life).	Youâ€™re	just	exhausted.	So	very,	very	exhausted.
Youâ€™ve	been	averaging	about	five	hours	of	sleep	per	nightâ€”actually	less	with
midterms	and	the	SAT	looming.	Plus,	you	have	a	ton	of	other	projects	due,	like
that	student	council	environmental	proposal	you	grudgingly	signed	up	for
because	it	was	going	to	look	good	on	your	college	and	scholarship	applications.
To	date,	youâ€™ve	filled	out	twenty-nine	applications.	Youâ€™re	desperate.	You
want	to	go	away	to	college	badly,	but	support	and	finances	are	limited.	These
obstacles	make	you	even	more	obsessed.
In	addition,	you	feel	shattered	after	finding	out	that	your	boyfriend	and	best
friend	have	started	seeing	each	other	behind	your	back.	Yes,	youâ€™ve	been	crazy
busy,	but	this	is	inexcusable.	The	betrayal	makes	you	feel	even	more	exhausted.
Before	crawling	into	bed,	you	thought	about	calling	someone	to	confide	in,	but
who	would	you	call?	Some	people	at	school	consider	you	â€œpopular,â€	but	they
donâ€™t	know	the	real	you.	They	only	know	the	people-pleasing	Jessicaâ€”the	one
who	wishes	everyone	would	like	her.
You	just	want	to	hibernate	until	graduation.	And	while	you	donâ€™t	physically
slow	down,	your	spirit	seems	to	withdraw	as	time	progresses.	Days	blur
together	from	so	many	simultaneous	responsibilitiesâ€”projects,	quizzes,	finals,
additional	applications,	club	meetings,	volunteering	opportunities,	etc.	Plus	you
have	to	take	the	ACT	because	you	choked	during	the	SAT.	Despite	your
ongoing	exhaustion,	you	manage	to	attend	a	few	parties	and	football	games,	but
you	continue	with	the	people-pleasing	faÃ§ade.	You	let	your	guard	down	with
that	cute	guy	from	advisory,	but	then	you	try	to	distance	yourself	emotionally
because	dating	someone	now	isnâ€™t	part	of	your	plan.]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Amazingly,	the	college	acceptances	start	rolling	in,	and	you	receive	quite	a	few
scholarships.	Youâ€™re	elatedâ€”youâ€™ve	accomplished	the	seemingly	impossible!
This	amazing	feeling	is	temporary,	though,	and	the	desperation	doesnâ€™t
dissipate.	If	anything,	you	put	more	pressure	on	yourself	as	you	prepare	for
college	and	your	future.	I	wish	that	your	adult	selfâ€”meâ€”could	intervene	and
tell	you	that	itâ€™s	not	right	to	make	success	your	god.	Unfortunately,	it	takes	a
breakdown	before	youâ€™ll	be	able	to	realize	this.
You	sign	up	for	eighteen	hours	of	classes	during	your	first	semester	at	college,
plus	join	a	couple	of	clubs	and	take	on	a	part-time	job.	This	is	more	than	you
can	handle,	and	youâ€™re	near	the	point	of	flipping	out.	So	when	you	get	an
opportunity	to	party	in	Mexico	with	some	new	friends,	youâ€™re	all	for	a	chance
to	escape.	With	each	sip	from	a	bottle	of	gin,	you	feel	layers	of	your	veneer
cracking,	and	your	anxiety	lessening.	Losing	control	feels	goodâ€”until	you
completely	lose	it.
Let	me	just	say	that	thereâ€™s	nothing	like	a	police-escorted	trip	to	the	hospital	to
make	you	rethink	your	priorities.	You	will	recover	from	this	worst	hangover	of
your	life,	and	your	soul	will	start	to	heal	too	(albeit	a	bit	more	slowly	than	your
black	eye).	While	there	are	many	things	you	can	control,	you	need	to	learn	to
let	go	in	more	appropriate	ways.	Try	losing	yourself	on	long	hikes,	or	while
writing.
And	by	the	way,	that	cute	guy	from	advisory?	Youâ€™ll	marry	him.

Sean	Beaudoin
Dear	Teen	Me,
Is	it	possible	that	this	arty	self-portrait	was	ever	really	me?	When	you	close
your	eyes,	you	can	almost	smell	the	incense.	This	shot	was	taken	before	digital
cameras	existed.	Back	then	film	was	expensive,	complicated,	and	difficult	to
process.	Remember	when	you	got	into	buying	old	cameras	at	the	Salvation
Army	and	then	sending	away	to	someplace	in	New	Jersey	for	obsolete	types	of
film?	Itâ€™s	hard	to	tell	if	that	was	an	inspired	hobby	or	just	the	product	of	sheer,
crushing	boredom.	In	any	case,	this	particular	shot	that	Iâ€™m	looking	at	now	was
taken	with	a	1950s	Polaroid	camera.	(You	paid	three	dollars	for	it	and	then
ruined	forty	dollarsâ€™	worth	of	film	learning	how	to	use	it.)	Apparently,	thereâ€™s	a
fine	line	between	nerd-rock	cover	art	and	self-indulgent	pretentiousness.
First,	you	found	some	â€œreally	cool	lightingâ€	in	which	to	linger.	Then	you
practiced	getting	just	the	right	facial	expression:	anguished,	hip,	tough,	and
worldly	(read:	non-virginal).	The	absurdly	heavy	camera	sat	atop	the	tripod	that
you	asked	for	(and	actually	got)	for	Christmas.	There	was	a	thumb	switch	at	the
end	of	a	long	cord	that	released	the	shutter.
Click.	Flash.	Genius.
You	laid	the	exposures	out	on	the	linoleum	floor	like	a	hand	of	solitaire,	and	for
some	reason	you	decided	that	this	one	was	the	best.	How	do	I	know?	Because
now	itâ€™s	the	only	one	left.	How	many	drawers	and	shoe	boxes	and	apartment
closets	has	it	sat	at	the	bottom	of?	How	many	moves	and	fires	and	storage-
space	purges	did	it	survive?	In	retrospect,	this	shot	may	not	be	the	artistic
breakthrough	it	once	seemed,	but	thereâ€™s	no	question	it	epitomizes	your	guiding
internal	mantra	that	year:	Things	Are	So	Very	Difficult,	But	I	Guess	Iâ€™ll	Deign	to
Persevere.
Also,	it	echoes	that	old	Depression-era	truism	that	â€œnothing	truly	good	ever
happens	unless	it	happens	under	light	spilled	through	a	dirty	venetian	blind.â€
Teen	Me,	all	I	can	say	is	that	I	miss	you	dearly.	I	miss	your	white	teeth.	Your
â€œgo	ahead	and	dare	me	to	cut	it	offâ€	ponytail.	The	red	Yukon	suit	you	wore	all]]></text>

supermodel	heads	torn	from	fashion	magazines	and	glued	to	the	cover	of	your
never-opened	Algebra	II	textbook.	It	was	a	liberating	and	exhilarating	feeling	to
recognize	that	(lowercase)	art	was	around	every	corner,	just	waiting	to	be	made
or	discovered.	Back	then,	everything	was	a	tool,	including	(and	especially)
yourself:	cameras,	clay,	pens,	glue,	crayons,	your	voice,	or	a	guitar.	The	idea	of
potential	practically	swirled	through	the	airâ€”a	cluster	of	insistent	notes	that
made	up	the	backbeat	of	almost	everything	connected	with	you	at	seventeen.
Teen	Me,	I	would	love	to	be	you	again,	even	for	just	an	hour.
Because	during	that	hour	I	would	write	the	first	fifteen	chapters	of	a	dystopian
novel	about	a	debutante	vampire	with	a	shopping	addiction,	bet	heavily	on	the
Super	Bowl,	pen	an	app	that	discourages	people	from	using	the	word	app	in	a
sentence,	and	marry	Natalie	Portman.
And	still	have	ten	minutes	to	spare,	just	hanging	out,	you	and	me.
Plenty	of	time	to	knock	out	two	or	three	more	masterpieces.

Charles	Benoit
Dear	Teen	Me,
Just	dropping	in	to	let	you	know	that	your	little	plan	actually	works.	Sure,	it
seems	crazy,	and	it	doesnâ€™t	start	off	well	at	all,	but	overall	youâ€™ll	be	pleasantly
surprised	about	how	it	turns	out.
Iâ€™m	stunned	you	ever	came	up	with	something	like	this	in	the	first	place.	You
certainly	have	reason	enough	to	tryâ€”I	mean,	something	has	to	happenâ€”but	we
both	know	that	â€œdoing	thingsâ€	was	never	your	specialty.	But	not	doing	things?
In	that	respect	youâ€™re	a	pro.	Not	talking	to	girls,	not	watching	what	you	eat,	not
caring	how	you	look,	not	standing	up	for	yourself,	not	trying	in	classâ€”nobody
does	nothing	better	than	you.
And	thatâ€™s	why	the	plan	seems	so	impossible.	I	mean,	itâ€™s	one	thing	to	say	you
want	to	change	your	hair;	itâ€™s	another	thing	entirely	to	say	youâ€™re	going	to
change	everything	about	yourselfâ€”the	way	you	look,	the	way	you	dress,	the
way	you	talk,	who	you	talk	to,	what	you	talk	about,	what	you	watch,	what	you
listen	to,	and	where	you	plan	to	go	on	Friday	night.	Everything.	And	youâ€™ve
given	yourself	two	months	to	do	it.	Thatâ€™s	your	plan,	anyway:	the	ultimate
makeover.	If	it	worksâ€”and	given	your	track	record,	you	have	no	reason	to
think	it	willâ€”youâ€™ll	start	tenth	grade	as	a	whole	new	person.	And	if	it	fails,
well,	youâ€™re	used	to	that.
Granted,	you	have	friends	and	you	have	a	great	(sometimes	strange)	family,	but
admit	it:	you	arenâ€™t	happy.	You	can	picture	the	guy	you	want	to	be.	Weâ€™re	not
talking	superpowers	or	sudden	musical	genius;	all	you	want	is	to	be	the	guy
who	doesnâ€™t	say	something	stupid	every	time	he	opens	his	mouth,	the	one	who
doesnâ€™t	get	picked	last	for	everything,	who	doesnâ€™t	let	jocks	push	him	around,
and	who	does	know	what	to	say	to	girls.	To	put	it	simply,	you	just	donâ€™t	want	to
be	you	anymore.
So	you	make	a	list.	The	cool	of	James	Bond,	the	wit	of	Steve	Martin,	the	quiet
toughness	of	Bruce	Lee.	Then	you	write	up	a	bunch	of	little	playsâ€”literally
write	them	outâ€”planning	what	youâ€™ll	say	when	you	sit	down	at	a	table	of	hot]]></text>

teacher	who	youâ€™ll	have	to	face	again	soon.	What,	maybe	twenty	scripts	or	so?
Then	itâ€™s	off	to	the	mall	for	a	new	look,	and	then	over	to	the	music	store	to	buy
the	albums	you	really	wantâ€”mostly	early	punk	stuffâ€”and	before	you	know	it,

gain	confidence;	people	see	that	youâ€™re	funny	(in	a	good	way,	for	once).	You

even	catch	a	beer	with	the	guys	who	used	to	pick	on	you	the	most.	Things

     <text><![CDATA[9	THINGS	YOU	NEED	TO	KNOW
Robin	Benway
Dear	Teen	Me,
1.	Letâ€™s	just	start	by	ripping	off	the	Band-Aid.	You	need	to	let	your	bangs
grow	out.	Iâ€™m	serious.	Half	of	your	teenage	life	(thatâ€™s	a	rough	estimate,	but
I	feel	like	itâ€™s	accurate)	will	be	spent	trying	to	straighten	them	and	the	other
half	will	be	spent	worrying	that	theyâ€™re	frizzing	up,	so	just	grow	them	out
now.	Youâ€™re	welcome.
2.	High	school	stops	mattering	the	second	you	graduate	from	it.	Crazy,	I
know,	but	itâ€™s	true!	Remember	how	upset	everyone	was	when	you	were	too
lazy	forgot	to	file	your	paperwork	for	the	National	Honor	Society?	Or	when
your	Spanish	teacher	got	mad	because	you	ditched	her	class	so	many	times?
It	turns	out	that	nobody	cares	whether	or	not	you	were	an	honors	student,
and	your	Spanish	skills	turn	out	to	be	quite	stellarâ€”especially	when	asking
for	directions	in	Spain	when	youâ€™re	thirty-two.	(Yes,	you	go	to	Spain.	And
Italy	and	France,	too.	Start	packing	now.)
3.	That	boy	in	your	chemistry	class	isnâ€™t	just	being	friendly.	Heâ€™s	flirting
with	you.	The	sooner	you	can	figure	out	the	difference	between	the	two,	the
easier	your	life	will	be.	And	you	really	need	to	talk	to	Chemistry	Boy	more,
because	on	the	last	day	of	senior	year,	he	will	write	a	beautiful	sentence	in
your	yearbook	that	involves	him	using	the	word	â€œperpetuallyâ€	correctlyâ€”
and	it	will	be	the	most	awesome	thing	that	has	ever	happened	to	you.	So
far.
4.	You	pick	amazing	friends.	All	those	girls	you	hang	out	with	at
lunchtime?	Youâ€™ll	still	be	hanging	out	with	them	when	youâ€™re	all	in	your
thirties.	Theyâ€™ll	still	make	you	laugh	until	you	have	to	pee,	and	theyâ€™ll	be
the	first	ones	to	call	you	when	things	go	horribly	wrong.	(Oops,	spoiler
alert!)
5.	Right	before	your	senior	year	of	high	school,	your	house	will	flood	while
youâ€™re	on	vacation	with	your	family	and	youâ€™ll	come	home	to	a	total
disaster.	Youâ€™ll	have	to	live	with	your	mother	and	younger	brother	in	a
hotel	room	for	the	next	three	months,	and	while	it	seems	insane	at	the	time,
the	three	of	you	will	become	closer	than	ever	before	as	a	result.	They	will]]></text>

  <page pageNumber = "19">
     <text><![CDATA[turn	out	to	be	two	of	your	best	friends,	and	youâ€™ll	find	yourselves	laughing
and	reminiscing	about	that	experience	time	and	time	again.	Believe	it	or
not,	it	actually	becomes	a	funny	story.	And	while	you	survive	the	hotel
experience	intact,	youâ€™ll	never	find	that	one	sweater	again.
6.	That	being	said,	before	you	go	on	vacation,	CHECK	TO	MAKE	SURE
A	PIPE	HASNâ€™T	BURST	BEFORE	LEAVING	THE	HOUSE.
SERIOUSLY.	GO	CHECK.
7.	Six	weeks	after	you	turn	eighteen,	youâ€™ll	move	to	New	York	City	to
attend	NYU	and	live	in	Greenwich	Village.	Sounds	awesome,	right?	Like	a
dream	come	true?	Well,	youâ€™ll	cry	like	a	baby	for	the	entire	first	week,	and
then	youâ€™ll	feel	so	homesick	that	youâ€™ll	construct	elaborate	fantasies	about
taking	a	cab	to	the	airport	and	flying	home.	Donâ€™t.	Stay	for	at	least	two
years.	Itâ€™s	good	for	you	to	be	in	a	new	city	with	new	people.	Youâ€™ll	learn
how	to	ride	the	subway	and	tell	the	difference	between	the	express	and
local	trains.	And	after	eighteen	years	in	Orange	County,	California,	youâ€™ll
finally	discover	what	â€œwinterâ€	really	means.	(Helpful	hint:	buy	a	sturdy
umbrella,	but	donâ€™t	bother	with	a	hat.	You	look	ridiculous	in	hats.)	If	you
leave	too	soon,	youâ€™ll	miss	walking	through	Washington	Square	Park	after
a	January	storm,	seeing	the	bare	trees	filled	with	flecks	of	icy	light,	and
feeling	the	contentment	that	comes	from	knowing	youâ€™re	exactly	where	you
ought	to	be.	Youâ€™ll	miss	that	exciting	night	at	the	diner	when,	for	reasons
that	are	never	made	entirely	clear,	your	waiter	has	to	run	outside	to	punch	a
passerby	while	you	huddle	with	the	rest	of	the	customers	in	the	back	of	the
restaurant,	waiting	for	the	police	to	arrive.	(Now	that	is	a	story	for	another
time.	But	donâ€™t	tell	Mom	about	it	until	youâ€™re	a	lot	older.	Sheâ€™ll	freak.)
8.	Thereâ€™s	going	to	be	a	period	in	your	life	where	everything	goes	wrong.	It
just	does.	Iâ€™m	sorry.	Your	grandparents	will	pass	away.	Your	dad	is	going
to	die.	Youâ€™ll	become	very	sick	and	have	to	quit	your	awesome	PR	job	at
the	bookstore.	Youâ€™ll	also	get	rejected	from	all	your	MFA	programs	on	the
same	day.	I	canâ€™t	sugarcoat	it;	itâ€™s	just	going	to	suck.	Youâ€™ll	cry	a	lot,	and
when	you	start	working	again	youâ€™ll	think	that	youâ€™ve	screwed	everything
up,	that	everything	you	want	to	achieve	will	never	happen.	Youâ€™ll	be
ashamed	of	your	life.
Please,	donâ€™t	worry.	You	worry	enough	as	it	is.	All	these	seemingly	wrong
turns	are	actually	leading	you	in	the	right	direction.	All	those	things	you
want	to	achieve	are	just	ahead	of	you,	so	donâ€™t	you	dare	stop	reaching	for
them.	Theyâ€™re	closer	than	you	realize,	and	if	you	stop,	if	you	give	up	and
give	in,	then	all	that	struggle	will	have	been	wasted.
9.	Youâ€™re	going	to	write	the	following	in	your	journal	on	January	23,	1996:]]></text>

Who	forgets	Nazis?

This	is	all	theyâ€™ve	told	you:	Your	dad	was	sixâ€”or	maybe	sevenâ€”when	the
Nazis	came.	His	house	was	in	Alsace-Lorraine;	or	no,	it	was	Schneidach;	no,
your	half-cousin	said	it	was	in	Munich.	Anyway,	the	Nazis	took	them	all:	mom,
dad,	grandmother,	and	your	fatherâ€”then	just	a	little	kid.	The	family	bounced
around	from	camp	to	camp	to	camp.
Thenâ€¦everyone	died.	Well,	everyone	except	your	dad.	Somehow	he	ended	up
in	Delaware.	The	rest	of	his	family	was	gassed	in	Auschwitz.	Period,	end	of
story.
When	you	ask	for	more,	youâ€™re	told	there	is	none.	Dad	doesnâ€™t	rememberâ€¦No,
he	doesnâ€™t	want	to	talk	about	itâ€¦No,	no,	it	was	all	so	long	ago,	and	anyway,

Benzes,	and	what	gives	with	that?
Onlyâ€¦your	dad	also	guards	his	food.	He	really	does.	And	talk	about	a	temper.
A	couple	times,	your	momâ€™s	had	to	pull	him	off	you.	Once,	you	even	thought

Your	mother	freezes.	Your	father	stares	at	you	from	the	couch.	Neither	says	a

if	you	should	repeat	what	youâ€™ve	just	said.	Maybe	your	dad	didnâ€™t	understand?
Maybe	heat	stroke	cooked	his	brain?
Then	your	father	sits	up,	very	slowly,	and	swings	his	legs	down.	â€œLet	me	check
this	out,â€	he	says.	â€œYou	stay	here.â€
He	heads	for	the	garage;	your	mom	stays	mum;	and	you	do	what	youâ€™re	told.

Finally,	the	family	room	door	opens	again	and	you	look	up,	thrilled,	because
now	he	will	have	to	tellâ€¦
But	his	hands	are	empty.
â€œWhere	is	it?â€	Youâ€™re	almost	tempted	to	look	behind	his	back,	like	you	did

What	the	Nazis	did	to	your	father	lives	in	him,	and	always	will.	That	kind	of

Marke	Bieschke
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™ve	just	turned	sixteen,	and	pretty	soon,	on	a	random	Saturday	night,	youâ€™re
going	to	roll	your	momâ€™s	car	out	of	the	garage,	start	it	up	down	the	street,	and
sneak	off	to	a	tiny	downtown	Detroit	nightclub.	That	night	is	going	to	change
your	life.	And	no,	itâ€™s	not	because	on	your	way	back	you	make	an	illegal	left-
hand	turn	into	the	police	chiefâ€™s	personal	car	and	get	totally	busted	for	taking
the	car	without	permissionâ€”although	that	certainly	throws	a	monkey	wrench
into	your	summer	plans.
But	that	night,	with	two	misfit	friends	at	your	side,	you	discover	an
underground	world	where	youâ€™re	accepted	for	the	fantastic	little	freak	that	you
areâ€”a	world	that	expresses	itself	though	music,	fashion,	and	dance	like	youâ€™ve
never	heard	or	seen	before.	Itâ€™s	full	of	outrageous	and	outspoken	weirdos	who
love	art	and	books	as	much	as	you	do,	and	who	want	to	hear	what	you	actually
think	about	things.	This	world	is	completely	opposed	to	your	everyday	high
school	reality,	where	people	beat	you	up	because	you	dye	your	hair	and	listen	to
bands	from	England.
Youâ€™ll	end	up	sneaking	out	again	and	again,	of	course.	Youâ€™ll	spend	your	days
fantasizing	about	the	next	club	night,	figuring	out	what	youâ€™re	going	to	wear,
what	youâ€™re	going	to	say,	and	how	youâ€™re	going	to	danceâ€”not	to	mention	how
youâ€™re	going	to	get	there.	Youâ€™ve	finally	found	a	place	where	you	belong!	(And
where	youâ€™re	not	the	only	one	whoâ€™s	gay.)	You	treasure	every	second	in	this
world,	and	eventually	it	wonâ€™t	just	be	your	passion;	it	will	be	your	career.
Looking	back,	however,	you	realize	something	else:	Taking	the	car	and	getting
caught	were	part	of	a	pattern	of	behavior	that	was	more	or	less	directly	tied	to
your	fatherâ€™s	alcoholism.	You	had	no	clue	what	was	going	on	at	the	timeâ€”your
motherâ€™s	largely	successful	attempts	to	hide	his	disease	will	implode	a	year
later,	when	your	dad	shocks	you	and	your	sister	by	bravely	and	successfully
checking	into	rehab.	He	didnâ€™t	beat	you	or	anything,	and	you	were	always
provided	for.	But	he	did	shut	you	out	in	weird	waysâ€”ways	that	made	you	feel
you	had	to	struggle	to	be	heard,	and	that	amplified	both	your	loneliness	and]]></text>

an	incomprehensible	situation,	trying	to	break	the	silence	about	something	you

Joseph	Bruchac
Dear	Teen	Me,
You	didnâ€™t	believe	that	what	your	grandmother	kept	telling	you	would	ever
come	true.	You	couldnâ€™t.	But	when	you	hit	your	growth	spurt	you	really	hit	it.
Suddenly,	you	were	bigger	and	stronger	than	all	of	the	guys	who	used	to	bully
you.	Youâ€™d	been	fired	after	your	first	day	as	a	caddy	because	you	couldnâ€™t	lug	a
golf	bag,	but	now	youâ€™re	the	right	tackle	on	the	football	team,	and	a	varsity
heavyweight	wrestler.
However,	Iâ€™m	sad	to	say	that	despite	the	growth	spurt	that	transformed	you
from	a	bullied	brainiac	into	a	major	jock,	youâ€™re	still	not	about	to	get	the	girl
anytime	soon.	Partly,	yes,	because	you	lack	smoothitude,	but	also	because
youâ€™re	not	willing	to	settle	for	just	anybody.	Your	grandmother	taught	you	to
respect	women	as	actual	human	beings	(and	not	to	look	at	them	as	objects),	and
you	learned	that	lesson	well.	Your	grandmother	was	one	of	the	first	women	to
pass	the	bar	in	New	York,	and	even	though	she	never	worked	as	an	attorney,
she	definitely	knew	how	to	â€œlay	down	the	lawâ€	on	your	behavior.
In	the	eternal	meantime,	youâ€™re	on	your	own,	and	you	are	not	getting	it	on.
Itâ€™s	senior	year	after	a	big	game.	Youâ€™re	eating	pizza	at	DeGregoryâ€™s	Restaurant
with	your	football	buddies.	Someone	comes	in	and	says	in	an	excited	whisper:
â€œLinda	S.	is	in	a	car	out	back.	Sheâ€™s	drunk	and	willing	to	make	out	with
anybody.â€
Linda	S.	is	a	pretty	blonde	girl	two	years	younger	than	you,	a	shy	country	kid
who	lives	only	a	mile	from	you.	You	donâ€™t	remember	getting	up	or	going
through	the	door,	but	the	next	thing	you	know	youâ€™re	in	the	alley	beside	that
car.	You	push	past	two	other	guys,	grab	skinny	Sammy	Carson	by	his	belt	and
toss	him	to	the	side.	But	then,	instead	of	climbing	into	the	back	of	that	wide-
seated	â€˜58	Buick,	you	take	Linda	S.	by	the	arm	and	lead	her,	her	on	unsteady
legs,	to	your	car.	Other	guys	step	aside	when	they	see	that	look	in	your	eye.
Sheâ€™s	crying	now.	You	give	her	your	handkerchief.	As	she	leans	against	the	car
door	you	remember	what	she	looked	like	five	years	ago	when	she	was	playing]]></text>

What	I	like	about	you	in	that	memory	is	not	just	what	you	did,	but	the	way	you

Louise	yourself?	(You	didnâ€™t.)	Did	you	do	the	right	thing?	(You	did.)
If	you	had	to	define	what	you	were	feeling	at	that	moment,	it	was	probably
sadness,	more	than	anything	else.	Until	this	letter	youâ€™ve	never	mentioned	what
happened	that	night	to	anyoneâ€”not	to	the	guys	who	avoided	you	as	you	walked

grandmother	(even	though	you	know	sheâ€™d	have	been	proud	of	the	way	you

Jessica	Burkhart
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™re	eighteen,	and	you	donâ€™t	trust	anyone.	Your	fatherâ€”an	abusive	con	man
â€”taught	you	that	lesson.	His	fraudulent	investment	schemes,	in	which	he	used
you	and	your	family	as	bait,	made	you	profoundly	suspicious	of	other	peopleâ€™s
motives.	But	hold	on:	An	opportunity	to	escape	is	coming.	The	thing	is,	it
depends	on	something	you	donâ€™t	really	haveâ€”trust.
The	next	year,	your	life	gets	both	better	and	worse	simultaneously.	You	get	a
book	deal.	Your	editor,	Kate,	becomes	your	best	friendâ€”she	becomes	the	big
sister	you	never	had.	The	connection	is	immediateâ€”one	youâ€™ve	never	had	with
anyone	before.	Soon,	you	love	each	other.	You	never	question	this.	Even
though	Dad	swore	no	one	would	ever	love	you,	someone	does.
Every	day	he	talks	about	how	your	only	responsibility	is	to	â€œthe	family.â€	He
says	that	nothing	is	more	important;	nothing	should	make	you	want	to	leave.
And	frankly,	it	seems	impossible	to	you	that	you	could	ever	manage	to	get
away	from	him.
But	Kateâ€™s	going	to	tell	you	something	unbelievable:	She	wants	to	help	you
escape.
You	have	one	opening.	You	say	yes	to	Kateâ€™s	offer.	Youâ€™re	supposed	to	go
from	Florida	to	New	York	with	just	a	single	suitcase.	No	Mutzie	(the	stuffed
puppy	you	slept	with	every	night);	no	dog-eared	copies	of	your	precious	Black
Stallion	books;	no	photos	of	your	brother.
I	know	that	this	decision	will	seem	to	be	the	hardest	part,	but	Iâ€™m	afraid	itâ€™s	not.
You	wobbleâ€”and	the	fear	almost	destroys	you.	You	wonâ€™t	be	able	to	eat	or
sleep	for	weeks.

You	cry.	Hard.	Hot	tears.	You	hate	her	for	saying	those	things.	Support	was
what	you	needed.	Or	at	least,	thatâ€™s	what	you	thought	then.	Now	you	know	that
she	gave	you	exactly	what	you	needed.	Kate	terrified	you	in	a	way	that	no	one
else	ever	hadâ€”not	even	Dad.	Losing	her	wasnâ€™t	an	option.
That	phone	call	gets	you	on	the	plane.	Months	later,	Kate	tells	you	how	she

of	speaking	to	you	that	way.	But	threatening	your	friendship	was	the	only	way

The	cafeteria	pizza	at	BU	is	disgusting,	but	you	and	the	kids	youâ€™re	hanging	out
with	eat	it	because	itâ€™s	Friday	night	and	hey,	youâ€™re	freshmen.	Youâ€™re	wearing	a
plastic	Dick	Tracy	movie-tie-in	hat.	(Youâ€™re	trying	to	make	that	your	â€œthing.â€)
Iâ€™m	sure	youâ€™ve	noticed	that	I	said	â€œthe	kids	youâ€™re	hanging	out	with,â€	and	not

Why	youâ€™re	even	hanging	out	with	these	kids	is	a	mystery,	because	as	far	as
youâ€™re	concerned,	nobody	likes	you.	Youâ€™re	not	doing	great	in	class,	and
nobody	else	wants	to	talk	about	cartoons	and	Muppetsâ€”instead,	they	want	to
talk	about	Shakespeare	and	Chekhov.	Everyone	else	came	from	fascinating

in	the	theater.
Youâ€™re	some	boring	guy	from	a	boring	suburb.
So	for	the	first	part	of	your	freshman	year,	you	try	to	communicate	to	everyone

You	wear	a	different	pair	of	crazy	sunglasses	every	day	of	the	week,	hoping
you	can	make	that	your	â€œthing.â€
You	never	work	with	other	students	unless	itâ€™s	absolutely	demanded	of	you,
and	instead	you	present	bombastic	monologues	about	murder	and	loneliness,
hoping	you	can	make	that	your	â€œthing.â€
You	work	your	ass	off	to	prove	to	people	that	you	are	awesome,	smart,	edgy,
and	talented.	You	work	harder	at	that	than	you	do	at	any	actual	schoolwork,
harder	than	you	even	work	on	your	own	art.	Whether	you	know	it	or	not,	this	is

Riley	Carney
Dear	Teen	Me,
You	know	that	dream	youâ€™ve	always	had?	The	one	about	becoming	an	author?
Iâ€™ll	let	you	in	on	a	secret:	It	does	happen.	You	make	it	happen.
But	itâ€™s	not	going	to	be	easy.	Youâ€™re	still	stuck	in	high	school	right	now.	I
remember	what	it	was	like,	and	I	know	exactly	how	you	feelâ€”it	seems	like	the
whole	thing	is	one	big	game;	that	youâ€™ll	never	find	your	place;	that	youâ€™ll	never
get	away	from	the	drama.
Like	with	your	â€œbestâ€	friend.	You	helped	her	with	her	homework,	you	were
nice	to	her,	and	you	provided	an	easy	boost	to	her	self-esteem.	She	never	really
cared	about	you,	though.	Once,	she	even	handed	out	Christmas	presents	in	front
of	you	and	conveniently	forgot	to	give	you	one.	And	I	also	remember	what	it
was	like	on	that	school	trip	where	you	had	to	sleep	in	the	top	bunk	above
feuding	friends	who	were	crying	hysterically.	The	drama	is	everywhere,	and	no
matter	how	hard	you	try	to	avoid	it,	you	canâ€™t	seem	to	get	away.
Youâ€™re	getting	tired	of	eating	lunch	alone	in	the	library	just	so	you	donâ€™t	have
to	wander	through	the	rows	of	tables	at	the	cafeteria	until	you	find	a	place	to	sit.
Youâ€™re	tired	of	people	who	just	want	to	use	you	for	homework	help.	Youâ€™re
tired	of	the	box	that	has	been	built	up	around	you,	tired	of	the	walls	that	keep
you	trapped,	that	keep	you	from	becoming	the	person	who	you	really	are	inside,
rather	than	the	person	who	everyone	thinks	you	are.
But	in	less	than	a	year,	everything	will	change.	Youâ€™ll	find	a	way	to	break	free
of	that	box	by	doing	something	youâ€™ve	always	loved.	Writing	will	be	your
outlet.	Youâ€™re	going	to	write	a	bookâ€”a	book	that	youâ€™ve	been	dreaming	about
for	years.	You	are	going	to	pour	your	heart	and	soul	into	that	book,	and	itâ€™s
going	to	be	published.	Over	the	next	three	years,	youâ€™ll	speak	at	schools	all	over
the	country,	something	you	never	thought	you	would	have	the	courage	to	do.
But	thereâ€™s	something	you	have	to	realize	before	you	can	break	free:	The	box
that	youâ€™re	in	is	only	as	strong	and	only	as	real	as	you	believe	it	to	be.]]></text>

and	cannot	do.	And	you	believed	them.	You	accepted	what	they	said.	You
stopped	believing	in	yourself.
You	stopped	believing	in	your	dreams.
But	little	by	little,	youâ€™ll	realize	that	the	box	doesnâ€™t	have	to	exist.	Once	you
start	writing	seriously,	youâ€™ll	discover	yourself,	and	youâ€™ll	realize	that	no	one
else	has	the	power	to	dictate	your	own	choices	and	your	dreams.
Youâ€™re	the	only	one	who	can	decide	your	future.	Youâ€™re	the	only	one	who	can
choose	the	person	you	want	to	be.
So,	Teen	Me,	itâ€™s	up	to	you.	It	only	takes	a	little	confidence,	a	little	daring,	and
a	willingness	to	risk	failure	to	tear	down	those	walls.	Donâ€™t	be	afraid	to	reach

Tera	Lynn	Childs
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™ve	always	been	a	planner.	From	the	time	you	first	broke	out	the	box	of
crayons	to	design	an	elaborate	rabbit	houseâ€”despite	the	fact	that	you	didnâ€™t
even	have	a	rabbit	yetâ€”to	all	the	hours	you	spent	in	high	school	plotting	out
your	college	years,	designing	your	dream	house,	and	even	just	figuring	out	how
you	could	get	to	college	early	so	youâ€™d	be	able	to	meet	your	favorite	basketball
player,	youâ€™ve	kept	the	future	squarely	in	your	sights.
Youâ€™re	always	thinking	ahead	to	the	next	stepâ€”and	thatâ€™s	greatâ€”but	good
planning	also	means	planning	in	moderation.	The	future	isnâ€™t	everything.
Sometimes	you	sacrifice	today	by	thinking	about	tomorrow.	You	need	to	slow
down	and	spend	some	time	in	the	moment,	because	there	are	a	lot	of	things	that
you	canâ€™t	plan	for,	and	lots	of	problems	that	planning	canâ€™t	solveâ€¦.
Planning	canâ€™t	keep	you	young.	Youâ€™ll	only	be	a	teenager	once,	and	you	should
enjoy	the	fun	and	freedom	of	those	years	while	you	can.	As	you	get	older	your
body	will	start	to	miss	those	days.	So	enjoy	them	to	the	fullest,	and	make	lots	of
great	memories.
Planning	wonâ€™t	determine	your	career.	You	will	spend	countless	hours
planning	for	potential	careers.	Among	the	many	career	paths	youâ€™ll	consider	are
architect,	lawyer,	environmental	biologist,	marine	biologist,	teacher,	actress,
professional	 tennis	 player,	 theater	 designer,	 historic	 preservationist,
veterinarian,	and	dozens	of	other	ideas	you	wonâ€™t	even	remember	twenty	years
from	now.	In	the	end,	youâ€™ll	find	your	passion	in	something	you	never	ever
considered	as	a	potential	career	plan.	I	wonâ€™t	spoil	the	discovery	by	telling	you
what	it	is,	but	youâ€™ll	love	it.
Planning	canâ€™t	replace	people	or	experiences.	Sometimes	you	get	frustrated	by
your	situation,	and	at	other	times	you	take	the	things	in	your	life	for	granted.
This	is	normal	teenage	angst,	but	on	the	great	big	scale	of	things,	your	life	is
pretty	great.	You	have	parents	and	an	extended	family	who	love	you.	You	have
great	friends,	a	roof	over	your	head,	food	on	your	table,	and	a	carâ€”]]></text>

Jessica	Corra
Dear	Teen	Me,
She	may	have	saved	your	life.
Big	Bernâ€”excuse	me,	Sister	Bernard	Agnesâ€”isnâ€™t	the	chatty	type.	Remember
when	she	yelled	at	the	entire	football	team?	Seriously,	sheâ€™s	not	to	be	messed
with.	The	vice	principal	may	be	the	school	disciplinarian,	but	Big	Bern	is	the
one	to	fear.
Sheâ€™s	tall	and	broad	and	imposing	and	no	one	wants	to	get	called	to	her	office.
You	never	thought	you	had	any	reason	to	worry,	really,	but	all	of	a	sudden	at
the	end	of	your	sophomore	year,	they	call	your	name	on	the	loudspeaker.	And
you	have	no	idea	why.	You	tremble	a	little	as	you	sit	down.	Youâ€™ve	talked	with
this	woman	before,	because	youâ€™re	a	goody-two-shoes	and	sheâ€™s	asked	you	to
help	with	projects	from	time	to	time,	so	maybe	thatâ€™s	the	reason.	You	donâ€™t
know	of	anything	you	could	have	made	a	mess	of,	but	maybe	youâ€™ve	forgotten
something.
She	lays	it	out	for	you:	She	heard	you	wanted	to	transfer	to	the	public	school,
and	she	wants	to	ask	you	why.	Shifting	on	the	hard	plastic	chair	to	avoid	the
full	force	of	her	attention,	you	have	to	admit	that	youâ€™re	miserable	at	this	tiny
private	school.	High	school	was	supposed	to	be	a	new	leaf,	but	it	never	turned
over.	Youâ€™ve	never	felt	like	you	fit	in,	and	you	sure	donâ€™t	have	any	friends.	In
fact,	outside	of	your	time	spent	at	the	community	theater	with	the	public	school
kids,	youâ€™re	pretty	depressed.	And	even	the	theater	isnâ€™t	going	so	well	right
now.	Youâ€™re	horrified	to	say	this,	and	youâ€™re	not	even	sure	why	you	do.	But
you	tell	her	the	truth.
You	both	sit	in	silence	for	a	moment,	but	then	Big	Bern	simply	suggests	that
you	go	to	the	school	library.	Thatâ€™s	all	she	says:	â€œTry	the	library.â€	She	isnâ€™t
motherly,	she	isnâ€™t	sympathetic,	but	she	is	awfully	insightful.	You	go	to	the
library.
The	library	aides	are	bookworms	and	they	welcome	you	immediately.	You	find
your	tribe	there,	and	you	stay	put.	This	turns	out	to	be	a	good	thing,	since	youâ€™ll]]></text>

Heather	Davis
Dear	Teen	Me,
Itâ€™s	not	easy	raising	yourself	and	your	sisters,	and	itâ€™s	not	fair.	Even	all	these
years	later,	as	I	look	back	at	all	youâ€™re	going	through,	it	still	makes	me	mad.
What	kind	of	a	mother	bails	out	on	her	daughters?
The	day	your	parents	told	you	they	were	getting	divorced	you	were	secretly
happy	that	you	and	your	sisters	would	be	living	with	Dad,	but	you	had	no	way
of	knowing	that	Mom	was	going	to	move	out	of	town.	And	then	out	of	state.
And	then	out	of	your	lives	altogether.
You	had	no	way	of	knowing	that	your	grandmother	would	be	the	one	to	take
you	to	be	fitted	for	your	first	bra.	She	would	have	to	be	the	one	to	buy	you	that
massive	box	of	feminine	pads	(which	would	sit	on	your	shelf,	untouched,	for
what	seemed	like	forever).
You	had	no	way	of	knowing	that	your	dad	would	come	to	rely	on	you	to	take
care	of	your	younger	sisters.	That	you	would	be	the	responsible	one.	The	one
who	doesnâ€™t	want	to	let	anyone	down.	The	one	who	your	sisters	look	up	to	and
then	later	resentâ€”after	all,	youâ€™re	more	than	a	sister,	but	less	than	a	parent.
But	you	donâ€™t	blame	Dadâ€”how	could	you?	Heâ€™s	a	single	parent,	coming	into
his	own	true	identity	away	from	Mom,	trying	his	best	to	help	you	along	the
way.	If	anything,	you	should	give	him	a	hug	and	tell	him	that	you	understand.
Years	later,	heâ€™ll	be	one	of	your	very	best	friends.
Youâ€™re	in	the	toughest	part	of	it	all	right	now.	During	these	teen	years,	your
mother	will	blow	into	town	every	once	in	a	while	to	ask	personal	questions	and
observe	you	like	youâ€™re	some	kind	of	science	experiment:	Did	you	get	your
period	yet?	Are	you	shaving	your	legs	now?	Did	you	pluck	your	eyebrows?
And	even	though	it	makes	you	uncomfortable,	you	answer,	because	she	is	your
mother.	You	answer	because	you	feel	you	should.	You	answer	because	you
donâ€™t	want	to	disappoint	herâ€”which	is	so	messed	up,	because	all	the	while

Daniel	Ehrenhaft
Dear	Teen	Me,
Picture	the	scene:	Your	boarding	school	crush	(weâ€™ll	just	leave	it	at	that	in	order
to	protect	her	identity	here)	has	asked	you	to	see	a	movie	in	New	York	City.
This	is	a	big	deal	for	all	sorts	of	reasons.	Even	though	theyâ€™re	arranged	by	your
boarding	school,	shuttle	bus	trips	to	New	York	City	suggest	the	possibility	of
something	exciting	and	dangerous.	So	yeah,	of	course	youâ€™re	going	to	go.
When	you	get	into	the	city,	you	sign	out	to	an	exact	locationâ€”a	movie	theater
or	a	gallery	or	something	like	thatâ€¦but	the	truth	is	that	you	only	have	two
goals	for	the	day:	(1)	find	a	hash	pipe	(even	though	youâ€™ll	overpay	for	one	and
never	use	it),	and	(2)	hook	up	with	your	Crush.
Your	Crush	is	already	in	New	York	City	visiting	her	family,	so	sheâ€™s	not	on	the
shuttle	bus.	But	youâ€™ve	arranged	a	meeting	spot:	a	bodega	off	of	Union	Square,
near	the	theater.
When	you	arrive,	sheâ€™s	not	there.
You	circle	the	block,	hoping	there	was	some	misunderstanding.	Youâ€™re	a
boarding	school	kid,	after	all;	New	York	City	is	full	of	secrets	that	only	the
locals	knowâ€”so	perhaps	thereâ€™s	another	bodega?	Since	ninth	grade,	youâ€™ve

LOSING	YOUR	RIGHTS
Laura	Ellen
Dear	Teen	Me,
Thereâ€™s	no	easy	way	to	say	this,	so	Iâ€™ll	just	be	blunt.	The	way	you	seeâ€”you
know,	with	that	sunspot-like-thing	that	blocks	your	central	vision?	Thatâ€™s	not
normal.	In	a	few	days	youâ€™re	going	to	go	to	the	eye	doctor	and	heâ€™s	going	to	tell
you	that	you	have	an	eye	disease	called	macular	degeneration.
Okay,	stop	freaking	out.	It	doesnâ€™t	mean	youâ€™re	dying.	But	it	does	mean	that
you	have	a	label	now,	â€œvisually	impaired,â€	which	will	affect	how	others	see	you
â€”and,	unfortunately,	how	you	see	yourself.
I	wonâ€™t	lie.	Life	is	about	to	get	really	hard.	At	times	it	will	downright	suck,
especially	when	you	discover	there	are	things	others	take	for	granted	that	you
just	canâ€™t	do.	Like	drive,	or	read	regular	print,	or	see	faces	unless	youâ€™re	really
close	up	(and	even	then	youâ€™ll	have	to	look	at	their	ears	to	see	their	eyes).
Weird,	I	know.
But	seriously,	who	cares?	Most	of	the	people	in	New	York	donâ€™t	drive,	and
there	are	audio	books	and	magnifying	glasses	and	ways	to	make	print	really
bigâ€¦.	It	never	gets	easy	staring	at	ears,	and	thereâ€™s	no	surefire	way	to	deal	with
the	jerks	who	embarrass	you	by	looking	all	around	before	asking,	â€œAre	you
talking	to	me?â€	And	yes,	all	of	that	stuff	will	make	you	feel	flawed	and
â€œabnormal.â€	But	normal	is	boring.	Itâ€™s	predictable	and	monotonous.
â€œDifferent,â€	though,	different	is	cool	and	intriguing	and	way	more	fun.
Some	of	your	teachers	will	try	to	pretend	you	see	like	everyone	else,	howeverâ€”
because	being	different	means	more	work	for	them.	They	donâ€™t	want	to	type
their	tests,	because	theyâ€™re	used	to	handwriting	them	at	the	last	minute,	and	they
donâ€™t	want	to	print	their	lecture	notes	in	advance,	because	they	actually	donâ€™t
have	any	notes;	they	usually	just	wing	it.
But	try	to	understand:	Their	refusal	to	help	has	nothing	to	do	with	you.	Theyâ€™re
tired	and	overworked	and	set	in	their	ways.	Theyâ€™ve	lost	sight	of	the	fact	that]]></text>

Shake	their	behavior	off.	I	promise,	for	the	handful	of	rude	and	ignorant
teachers	that	youâ€™ll	have	to	deal	with,	there	will	be	so	many	more	who	will	go

corner	when	that	Spanish	teacher	writes	the	entire	exam	on	the	board	and
doesnâ€™t	let	you	get	out	of	your	seat	to	read	it.
Stand	up	for	yourself.
I	know,	as	shy	and	timid	as	you	are,	itâ€™s	hard	to	imagine	pushing	back,	but	do	it.
If	you	donâ€™t,	no	one	else	will.	Those	teachers	are	banking	on	your	passivity,	so
that	they	can	continue	to	sit	and	be	passive	themselves.	Donâ€™t	let	them	get	away
with	it.	What	those	teachers	are	doing,	or	not	doing,	is	wrong.	And	when	they
humiliate	you	in	front	of	the	class	with	their	insensitive	remarks,	not	only	is	that
wrong,	thatâ€™s	bullying.	And	itâ€™s	not	okay.
Soâ€¦
Open	your	mouth.
Say	something.
Refuse	to	accept	it.
Youâ€™re	not	a	second-class	citizen;	donâ€™t	let	them	treat	you	like	one.
This	whole	thing	is	a	lot	to	hear,	and	Iâ€™m	sorry	if	itâ€™s	a	bit	overwhelming,	but	I
need	to	tell	you	a	little	more.	As	your	eyes	get	worse	and	you	find	yourself
battling	ignorant,	insensitive	individuals	on	a	daily	basis,	youâ€™re	going	to
become	angry	and	frustrated,	and	very,	very	confused.	Everyone	suddenly
treats	you	differently,	but	you	donâ€™t	feel	any	different.	This	will	make	you
wonder	if	they	see	someone	else	when	they	look	at	you.	Youâ€™ll	start	doubting

You	can	do	this.	I	promise.

your	family	and	friends	donâ€™t	understandâ€”and,	well,	they	donâ€™t.	But	neither	do
you,	right?	This	whole	thing	is	new	to	everyone,	and	no	one	knows	quite	how
to	act	or	what	to	say	or	what	to	do.	Donâ€™t	let	all	that	confusion	stop	you.	Tell
them	how	lost	you	feel.	Let	them	help	you.
And	try	not	to	trade	your	friends	for	those	idiot	boyfriends	I	can	see	creeping
up.	Once	upon	a	timeâ€”okay,	just	a	year	before	you	were	first	diagnosedâ€”you
were	interested	in	sweet,	decent	guys.	But	when	your	confidence	began	to
plummet	and	you	started	doubting	yourself,	you	left	your	friends	behind	and
started	gravitating	toward	losers.
I	get	it.	I	do.	Things	with	your	friends	have	gotten	a	little	weird.	You	hate	that
they	always	have	to	drive	you	around	and	read	the	menu	to	you.	You	feel	like
youâ€™re	a	burden	to	them.	Meanwhile,	those	guys	make	you	feel	wanted.
Normal.	And	they	never	ask	you	any	questions	about	your	eyesight,	which
comes	as	a	reliefâ€”even	though	your	friends	are	only	asking	because	they
actually	care	(which	is	more	than	I	can	say	about	those	guys).	So	instead	of
drowning	yourself	in	the	loser	brigade	and	getting	hung	up	on	what	you	canâ€™t
do,	focus	your	energy	on	what	you	can	do.
Stay	away	from	the	guy	who	acts	like	you	have	to	be	with	him	every	waking
moment	(he	cheats	on	you	when	youâ€™re	out	with	your	friends).	Run	from	the
guy	who	demeans	you,	insults	you,	and	throws	your	eyesight	in	your	face	like
itâ€™s	something	shameful	that	no	one	but	him	would	ever	put	up	with	(thatâ€™s
emotional	abuseâ€”and	he	has	no	right	to	treat	you	like	that).	These	guys	know
they	donâ€™t	deserve	you,	but	they	also	know	your	eyesight	has	made	you
insecure	and	self-consciousâ€”weaknesses	that	losers	like	them	are	looking	to
prey	on.	Youâ€™re	not	a	loser,	so	donâ€™t	date	guys	who	treat	you	like	one.	Having
an	eye	disease	doesnâ€™t	make	you	any	less	of	a	human	being.
And	the	other	guy?	The	one	that	you	think	is	so	different	from	the	others?	I
know	how	nice	he	seemsâ€”and	he	is	nice.	He	doesnâ€™t	call	you	names	or	put	you

FROM	BONANZA
Beth	Fantaskey
Dear	Teen	Me,
First	of	all,	rest	easy:	Mom	and	Dadâ€™s	prediction	that	youâ€™ll	â€œburn	the	house
down	someday	with	that	deep	fryerâ€	will	never	be	realized.	Of	course,	this	is
largely	because	your	parents	will	ban	you	from	ever	using	the	deep	fryer,	after
what	you	did	to	their	kitchen.	(Unfortunately,	youâ€™ll	never	be	the	type	of	person
who	can	be	trusted	with	hot	grease.)
Similarlyâ€”and	this	may	disappoint	youâ€”you	will	always	be	weird	and	shy.
While	youâ€™ll	eventually	lose	your	unruly	curls	and	adopt	a	trademark	â€œpixieâ€
cut,	you	canâ€™t	snip	away	these	traits,	which	are	so	central	to	your	personality.
Right	now	youâ€™re	worried	about	both	your	shyness	and	your	weirdness.	Itâ€™s
clear	that	youâ€™re	never	going	to	be	a	cheerleader	or	go	to	the	big	parties	on	the
riverbank.	And	not	only	is	it	obvious	that	youâ€™ll	never	date	a	football	star,	but
also,	right	now,	youâ€™re	worried	that	youâ€™ll	never	date	anyone.	Ever.	(But	donâ€™t
worry:	you	will.)
And	yet:	Youâ€™ve	got	lots	of	great	friends	who	are	also	on	the	margins,	and	there
are	moments	when	you	see	through	the	myth	of	â€œpopularityâ€	to	realize	that	you
secretly	like	your	spot	among	the	geeks,	dweebs,	and	â€œartyâ€	kids.	Thereâ€™s	the
day	Bonnie	eloquently	challenges	your	civics	teacherâ€™s	opinions	on	Keynesian
economics,	leaving	everybody	speechless.	And	the	night	when	Sandra	unveils	a
stack	of	records	from	an	old	jukebox,	and	you	spend	hours	dancing	to	the	theme
from	Bonanza.	And	there	will	also	be	a	moment	when	one	of	your	closest	male
friends	finds	enough	courage	and	support	to	come	out	while	you	guys	are	all
sitting	around	the	campfire.
All	this	stuffâ€”it	leaves	you	conflicted.	Youâ€™re	pretty	sure	that	the	popular

Caridad	Ferrer
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™ve	got	a	bad	case	of	the	Jekyll	and	Hydes.	I	mean,	sans	the	whole	split-
personality	thing,	it	pretty	much	nails	you,	doesnâ€™t	it?	Câ€™mon,	letâ€™s	examine	the
evidence.
Thereâ€™s	the	side	thatâ€™s	crazy	shy	(letâ€™s	refer	to	this	as	the	Jekyll	half)	and	born
into	a	family	that	Just	Doesnâ€™t	Get	It.	They	donâ€™t	even	know	how	to	spell	shy.
Your	dad	is	the	life	of	the	party;	your	mother	is	a	natural	attention	(read:
â€œmanâ€)	magnet;	your	brother	could	sell	ice	to	an	Eskimo,	and	your	sisterâ€™s	idea
of	a	good	time	is	going	into	a	room	where	she	doesnâ€™t	know	a	single	soul.	And
thatâ€™s	just	your	immediate	family.	The	rest	of	the	relatives?	They	arenâ€™t	any
better,	most	of	them	falling	under	some	variation	on	a	theme	of	Extreme
Extrovert.
Pfft.
To	you,	shoving	bamboo	shoots	under	your	fingernails	sounds	like	a	better
alternative	to	small	talk.
So	to	say	they	donâ€™t	understand	what	you	mean	when	you	say	youâ€™re	feeling
shy	is	putting	it	mildly.	They	think	itâ€™s	a	silly	pretense,	especially	when	you
balk	at	being	paraded	in	public	like	a	trained	monkey,	playing	the	Bach
Invention	that	won	you	that	piano	competition	or	reciting	the	poem	that	your
fifth-grade	teacher	insisted	on	entering	in	the	Dade	County	Youth	Fair,	and
which	won	first	place.	Which	brings	us	to	the	second	reason	why	they	have	a
hard	time	understanding	your	reactions.	After	all,	why	on	earth	do	you	enter
competitions	if	you	donâ€™t	want	the	attention,	right?
Which	brings	us	to	Hyde.	That	side	of	your	personality	is	as	competitive	as
Jekyll	is	shy.	But	explaining	that	you	love	competitionâ€”that	you	love
competing	against	yourself	as	much	as	you	love	competing	against	othersâ€”is
usually	met	with	blank	stares.	They	donâ€™t	get	that	youâ€™re	simply	incapable	of
taking	on	a	pursuit	if	you	donâ€™t	intend	to	become	the	best	you	personally	can.

Michael	Griffo
Dear	Teen	Me,
At	some	moments	it	seems	like	it	truly	has	been	thirty	years	since	I	was	in	high
school.	But	at	other	times	I	can	still	hear	the	late	bell	ringing	and	the	locker
doors	slamming	shut.	Itâ€™s	like	Iâ€™m	still	there	with	you,	like	a	part	of	me	has
never	let	go.
So	much	happened	during	those	four	years,	but	the	most	rewarding	and	life-
changing	experience	occurred	when	you	were	cast	in	the	school	play.	Do	you
remember	how	quickly	you	made	new	friends,	gained	respect	from	your
teachers,	and	learned	that	you	loved	being	onstage?	It	was	also	the	first	time
you	fell	in	love.
I	wonder:	Was	it	really	Love,	with	a	capital	L?	Iâ€™m	still	not	sure,	but	it	was	the
first	time	you	thought	about	wanting	to	kiss	another	person.	The	first	time	your
palms	got	sweaty	when	you	were	standing	next	to	someone	else.	And	the	first
time	you	were	forced	to	admit	that	these	â€œfirstsâ€	were	happening	because	of
another	guy.
I	donâ€™t	even	remember	his	name.	Can	you	believe	that!?	But	I	can	see	his	face
so	clearly	itâ€™s	as	if	Iâ€™m	back	onstage,	dressed	as	Barnaby	Tucker	in	the	musical
Hello,	Dolly!	and	heâ€™s	standing	right	next	to	me	dressed	in	a	brown	plaid	wool
suit,	his	curly	blonde	hair	spilling	out	from	underneath	his	cap,	as	weâ€™re	about
to	perform	the	song	â€œFemininity.â€	(Isnâ€™t	that	an	ironic	title?!)
During	the	song,	you	had	to	do	a	barrel	roll	over	this	guyâ€™s	back	and	then	jump
back	on	top	of	him.	You	were	short	and	he	was	quite	tall	and	muscular	and	you
loved	the	view	of	the	world	when	you	were	holding	onto	his	shoulders.	And
you	never	wanted	to	let	go.	You	developed	a	powerful	crush	on	him.	So
powerful	and	eye-opening	that	you	never	told	another	soul.	You	kept	silent
simply	because	you	were	too	embarrassed	and	ashamed.	And	when	he	would
smile	at	you	and	ask	how	you	were	doing,	you	would	lie	and	say	that	you	were
fine.
This	started	you	on	a	long	and	successful	career	of	lying.	Of	keeping	the	truth]]></text>

long	time	and	it	stunted	your	emotional	growth.	You	had	no	idea	how	to	form
an	honest,	adult	relationship,	because	you	couldnâ€™t	form	an	honest	relationship
with	yourself.	And	you	didnâ€™t	know	how	to	act	with	other	guys	because	you
never	took	chances.	I	donâ€™t	think	you	should	have	professed	your	undying	love
to	your	onstage	partner,	but	you	definitely	should	have	looked	yourself	in	the
mirror	and	been	honest.	You	should	have	told	yourself	that	these	feelings	you
had	were	real.	And	you	should	have	confided	in	your	parents,	or	talked	with
Rob	or	Donâ€”your	closest	friendsâ€”and	asked	them	to	share	some	of	the	burden
that	you	were	carrying;	thatâ€™s	what	family	and	friends	are	there	for.	You
shouldnâ€™t	have	tried	to	do	it	on	your	own.
So	Michael,	if	youâ€™re	listening,	donâ€™t	spend	time	living	your	life	in	a	vacuum.
Reach	out	to	someone	you	can	trustâ€”a	parent,	a	teacher,	a	friendâ€”and	tell
them	whatâ€™s	going	on	inside	your	brain	and	your	heart.	Donâ€™t	worry	about	how
theyâ€™ll	react;	they	may	be	surprised,	and	they	may	not	understand,	but	at	least
theyâ€™ll	know.
Which	means	that	no	matter	what,	you	wonâ€™t	ever	be	alone	again.

Janet	Gurtler
Dear	Teen	Me,
Itâ€™s	kind	of	a	rush	isnâ€™t	itâ€”how	thin	youâ€™ve	become?	It	started	with	that	boy
youâ€™d	been	crushing	on.	Your	best	friend	asked	him	what	he	thought	of	you,
and	in	response	he	reversed	the	words	from	the	punk	rock	song	by	the	Monks
you	all	loved	so	much:	Instead	of	â€œNice	legs.	Shame	about	her	face,â€	he	sang,
â€œNice	face.	Shame	about	her	legs.â€
Wow!	That	comment	hurt	so	much	you	couldnâ€™t	breathe	for	a	minute,	and	a
shamed	blush	stained	your	cheeks.	You	hated	being	the	chubby	one	in	a	family
full	of	thin	kids,	and	suspected	that	your	size	made	you	inadequate	in	some
way.	Teasing	sucked,	but	this	was	different.	This	was	from	a	boy	you	liked.
And	it	was	devastating	to	your	already	fragile	ego.	So	a	diet	followed	and	the
weight	dropped	off.
And	for	the	first	time	now	youâ€™re	actually	skinny.	What	a	trip!	You	feel
powerful,	and	really	in	control.	I	can	see	why	itâ€™s	hard	to	say	no	to	the	attention
â€”the	positive	attentionâ€”that	the	weight	loss	gets	you.	You	start	hanging	out
with	the	popular	girls	again,	as	if	thinness	makes	you	worthy,	but	inside	you
feel	empty.	Physically	and	emotionally.	They	love	how	skinny	youâ€™ve	become,
though,	all	those	thin	girls.	When	one	of	them	brags	about	fitting	into	a	pair	of
your	jeans	you	feel	like	youâ€™ve	made	it.	Like	your	thinness	is	something	to	be
desired.
Unfortunately,	taking	it	off	isnâ€™t	the	hard	part.	Starving	yourself	is	sustainable
for	a	while,	but	itâ€™s	hard	to	keep	up.	Youâ€™re	basing	your	worth	on	how	many
calories	you	consume.	And	so	now,	when	you	do	eat,	itâ€™s	pure	guilt.	Which
leads	to	binges,	and	more	guilt.	And	then	youâ€™re	starving	yourself	again.	Youâ€™re
caught	up	in	a	vicious	cycle.
But	then	another	skinny	girl	at	school	shares	a	secret	with	you:	throwing	up.
You	try	it,	but	youâ€™re	not	very	good	at	it.	That	makes	you	feel	like	even	more	of
a	failure,	and	the	weight	piles	back	on	again,	but	Iâ€™m	so	happy	now	that	you
couldnâ€™t	make	yourself	do	it.	Itâ€™s	a	dangerous,	dangerous	way	to	live,	and	some]]></text>

Kersten	Hamilton
Dear	Teen	Me,
Some	people	say	God	doesnâ€™t	allow	us	to	see	our	futures	because	we	wouldnâ€™t
have	the	courage	to	face	all	that	trouble	and	heartbreak	if	we	saw	it	all	at	once
â€”but	I	donâ€™t	think	thatâ€™s	true.	The	thing	is,	I	know	a	secret	that	youâ€™re	just
beginning	to	learn,	and	this	secret	isnâ€™t	just	important	for	your	dream	of
becoming	a	writer,	itâ€™s	also	critical	to	your	survival.	So	Iâ€™m	going	to	give	you	a
little	peek	into	the	days	ahead.
It	starts	with	that	litter	of	puppies.	Theyâ€™re	three	days	old,	and	their	mother	is
dead.	Everyone	says	you	should	drown	them	because	theyâ€™re	going	to	die
anyway	without	a	mama	dog	to	feed	them.	Thatâ€™s	what	they	say.	Youâ€™re
thirteen,	but	you	gave	up	listening	to	what	people	said	years	ago.	Youâ€™ve
learned	to	think	for	yourself.	You	donâ€™t	trust	adults.
Your	mom	left	when	you	were	six.	She	fell	in	love	with	a	man	who	didnâ€™t	want
kids,	and	she	chose	him	over	you	and	your	brothers	and	sister.	You	havenâ€™t
seen	or	heard	from	her	since	you	were	seven.
Your	dad	is	an	amazing	storytellerâ€”very	charismatic.	He	can	convince	anyone
that	heâ€™s	completely,	totally	sane.	He	doesnâ€™t	tell	them	about	the	â€œvoiceâ€	that
tells	him	when	to	quit	each	job	he	gets,	when	to	sleep,	when	to	eat,	and	when
itâ€™s	safe	to	walk	down	the	street.
Youâ€™ve	had	it	with	death	and	loss	and	craziness.	You	decide	youâ€™re	not	going	to
kill	the	innocent	little	puppies.	Not	going	to	let	it	happen.	And	thatâ€™s	a	good
choice,	teen	self.	Youâ€™ll	save	them	all,	and	name	the	one	you	keep	Shadrach
(after	they	boy	in	the	Bible	who	came	through	a	fiery	furnace	and	lived	to	tell
about	it).	Heâ€™s	a	yellow	mutt	with	a	black	muzzle,	and	heâ€™ll	repay	you	a
thousand,	thousand	times	for	saving	his	life.
Before	Shadâ€™s	a	year	old,	the	â€œvoiceâ€	will	tell	your	dad	to	stop	talking	to	you.
Youâ€™ll	have	to	make	all	your	own	decisions	from	that	moment	on,	and	youâ€™ll
make	some	bad	ones.	Youâ€™ll	drop	out	of	high	school	after	your	freshman	year.
Really	bad	choice.	And	because	youâ€™re	not	in	school,	no	one	will	notice	when]]></text>

The	â€œvoiceâ€	says	the	world	is	going	to	end	and	demands	that	the	family	get	off
the	grid	before	it	does.	Youâ€™ll	spend	the	rest	of	your	teen	years	moving	from
one	hiding	place	to	another.	Youâ€™ll	live	in	shacks	and	abandoned	houses.	And
you	will	be	so,	so	isolated	(i.e.,	youâ€™ll	have	absolutely	no	human	contact	outside
of	your	immediate	family).	Your	dad	still	refuses	to	speak	to	you.	Itâ€™s	only
because	of	Shad	that	your	heart	doesnâ€™t	wither	and	die.	Youâ€™ll	love	Shad,	and
heâ€™ll	love	you,	no	matter	what.
Listen:	As	soon	as	your	brothers	are	old	enough	to	look	after	themselves,	you
need	to	get	out	of	there.	Things	are	different	for	girls	in	your	family.	Run.
Wherever	you	wind	up	going,	it	will	be	good	to	have	Shad	with	you.
And	when	you	eventually	meet	your	motherâ€”try	to	understand	that	she	is	as
broken	as	your	dad.	It	wasnâ€™t	anything	you	did	or	said	when	you	were	seven
that	made	her	leave.
The	fact	is,	we	canâ€™t	know	what	the	future	holds,	because	it	doesnâ€™t	exist	yetâ€”it
doesnâ€™t	exist	until	we	create	it.	No	matter	where	you	start,	and	no	matter	where
you	are	today,	you	can	dream	a	new	tomorrow.	Your	parents	canâ€™t	stop	you.
You	can	create	it	through	the	choices	you	make	(like	the	choice	to	save	a
puppy).	If	you	have	no	adult	to	trust	as	a	child,	choose	to	become	an	adult	that
children	can	trust.

Bethany	Hegedus
Dear	Teen	Me,
You	stare	at	the	neon	green	light	on	your	bedside	digital	clock.	In	a	few	more
minutes,	youâ€™ll	let	Drew	goâ€”like,	all	the	way.	Youâ€™ve	made	up	your	mind.
Thatâ€™s	why	youâ€™re	here	in	the	middle	of	the	night.	Thatâ€™s	why	you	let	Drewâ€™s
best	friend,	Nate,	pick	you	up	after	you	snuck	out	of	bed,	crept	down	the	stairs
to	the	kitchen,	and	out	the	garage	door.	Not	the	big	garage	door	with	its
electronic	switch,	but	the	side	door	that	opens	to	the	backyardâ€”to	where	your
familyâ€™s	golden	retrievers	sleep.	Both	Rainy	and	Snowy	bark	at	you,	and	at	that
point	you	almost	head	back	inside.	Almost.	Instead	you	run.	You	run	for	the
corner.
When	Nate	picks	you	up,	you	donâ€™t	know	what	to	say.	Heâ€™s	your	friend.
Youâ€™ve	known	him	for	the	two	years	youâ€™ve	been	dating	Drew	on	and	off.	You
donâ€™t	go	to	the	same	high	school	anymore.	(Zoning.)	Nate	plays	saxophone	in
the	marching	band.	Drew	plays	trumpet.
Nate	fiddles	with	the	car	radio	and	mentions	that	Drewâ€™s	car	is	in	the	shop.	You
make	small	talk.	Uncomfortable	small	talk.	Your	best	friend,	Andrea,	dated
Nate	for	a	few	weeks.	They	broke	up	when	she	wouldnâ€™t	give	him	a	BJ.	Dad
thinks	black	guys	are	only	after	one	thingâ€”sexâ€”but	you	know	thatâ€™s	not	true.
You	and	Drew	have	been	dating	for	a	long	time.	You	make	out.	You	touch	one
another.	But	youâ€™ve	never	gone	all	the	way.	He	hasnâ€™t	threatened	to	break	up
with	you	if	you	donâ€™t.
Tonight	is	the	nightâ€”you	know	it.
Youâ€™re	in	his	bedroom.	Drew	nuzzles	your	ear.	Youâ€™ve	been	kissing	for	what
feels	like	hours.	The	bed	creaks	and	your	bodies	shift.	Your	journal	is	filled
with	poems	about	Drew.	About	how	Drew	feels	about	you.	About	how	hard	it	is
to	date	a	black	guy.	To	deal	with	the	stares	of	people	in	the	mall.	Or	the	movies.
Not	that	you	guys	go	out	very	often.	Neither	of	you	likes	the	stares.
Your	friend	Alicia	lives	in	the	same	neighborhood	as	Drew.	Her	dad	is	a

his	dad,	his	little	sister.	Why	havenâ€™t	you	met	any	of	them?	Is	Drew	ashamed	of
you?	Of	your	whiteness?
You	stare	at	the	clock.	The	deadline	has	passed.	Youâ€™ve	been	doing	that	all
night.	Adding	five	more	minutesâ€”working	up	your	nerve.	Youâ€™re	ready	to	go
all	the	way.	Youâ€™re	about	to	whisper,	â€œI	love	you,	Drew,â€	when	he	shifts	his
body.	He	rolls	away	from	you,	pulls	up	his	jeans,	zips	his	zipper.	â€œYou	better
go.	Itâ€™s	getting	late.â€
You	pull	down	your	skirt,	slide	back	into	your	bra.	You	stand	like	strangers	in
the	dark.
Drew	never	knew	that	you	wanted	him	to	be	your	first.	Five	days	later,	you	find
out	heâ€™s	started	seeing	someone	else.	A	girl	who	goes	to	his	high	school.
A	few	years	later,	when	you	do	go	all	the	way,	itâ€™s	a	joint	decisionâ€”something
thatâ€™s	spoken	about	beforehand	and	attempted	over	and	over	again.	(Who	knew
losing	your	virginity	would	take	more	than	one	try?)	And	when	it	does	happen,
no	oneâ€™s	best	friend	picks	you	up.	You	drive	yourself	there	and	you	drive
yourself	back	home.	And	looking	back,	youâ€™re	gloriously	relieved	that	your
decision	wasnâ€™t	dictated	by	the	flashing	of	a	bedside	clock,	but	by	your	own
internal	clock	instead.

Humiliation	and	hilarity	are	closely	linked,	my	little	friend.	Donâ€™t	lie	there	in

I	love	it	when	you	take	your	giant	piece	of	cardboard	(mobile	dance	floor)
down	to	the	corner	of	Kase	Street	and	Highway	81	to	dance	for	traffic.	Maybe
youâ€™re	right.	Maybe	a	talent	scout	will	be	driving	between	Stitzer	and	Hazel
Green.	Maybe	you	will	be	discoveredâ€¦Keep	at	it!
I	love	it	that	you	have	the	guts	to	go	into	Kennedy	Mall	in	Dubuque,	Iowa	to
dance	across	from	Hot	Samâ€™s	Pretzels.	You	and	your	buddies	go	for	broke	in

security	comes	to	escort	you	out,	you	scream,	â€œDancing	is	not	a	crime!â€	I	love
that.
I	especially	love	what	happened	at	Dubuqueâ€™s	Five	Flags	Center	a	few	months

on	them.	You	worked	hard,	and	you	daydreamed	harder.	You	imagined	the
roaring	crowd	lifting	you	onto	their	shoulders.	You	didnâ€™t	expect	the	Five	Flags
floor	to	be	so	sticky.	You	didnâ€™t	expect	to	sweat	through	your	new	shirt.	You
didnâ€™t	expect	the	flesh	of	your	back	to	be	gripped	and	twisted	so	that	it	felt	like

the	epic	falls,	and	the	punishing	jeers	of	your	classmates.	You	think	about	how
excellent	it	is	that	you	got	up,	dusted	yourself	off,	and	with	utter	seriousness	of
purpose,	tried	again.
Your	immense	dorkiness	as	a	teen	will	be	the	center	of	your	artistic	life,	the
center	of	your	sense	of	humor,	the	center	of	ongoing	friendships	with	so	many
of	the	kids	you	knew	back	then.	(You	guys	never	discuss	the	relatively	boring
victoriesâ€”you	only	talk	about	the	grand,	majestic,	hilarious	failures.)
What	if	you	hit	it	big	at	that	contest?	Would	you	be	a	professional	break-dancer
now?	Would	success	have	gone	to	your	head?	Or	would	you	be	a	rich	banker?
Or	a	lawyer?	Terrible!
But	instead,	you	stuck	to	that	floor,	with	your	back	on	fire	with	the	pain,	and
you	screamed.
Donâ€™t	beat	yourself	up	over	it,	okay?	Just	relax.	Keep	dancing	by	the	highway,
you	splendid	little	dork.

Nancy	Holder
Dear	Teen	Me,
Excuse	me	for	interrupting	you	while	youâ€™re	hard	at	work.	In	the	picture	Iâ€™m
looking	at,	in	the	moment	Iâ€™m	thinking	of,	youâ€™re	choreographing	a	piece	to
â€œLady	Jane,â€	by	the	Rolling	Stones.	Youâ€™ve	organized	your	dancers	into	three
groups,	weaving	them	in	and	out	of	the	intricate	threads	of	guitar	and
harpsichord	and	dulcimer.	Every	time	you	work	on	the	piece	you	canâ€™t	catch
your	breath.	Youâ€™re	nervous	and	exhilarated	and	you	wonder	if	youâ€™re	crazy
because	getting	this	right	means	so	much	to	you;	you	feel	every	note	so	deeply.
The	song	sounds	plaintive,	sinister,	and	sexy	all	at	the	same	time.	You	keep
seeing	Mick	Jagger	sneering	as	he	gazes	at	some	poor	Tudor	girl	sobbing
because	heâ€™s	dumping	her.	In	your	imagination,	he	looks	like	David	Bowie	as
the	Demon	King	in	Labyrinth.	Different	rocker,	same	edge.
You	are	firmly	convinced	you	have	no	edge.	Though	itâ€™s	hard	to	believe	here	in
the	future,	youâ€™re	still	very	shy	right	now.	You	donâ€™t	tell	anyone	how	deeply
that	song	moves	you,	especially	since	youâ€™re	not	totally	sure	what	itâ€™s	all	about.
But	when	you	listen	to	it,	you	feel	as	if	thereâ€™s	a	world	living	and	breathing
inside	the	music.	It	seems	like,	in	a	way,	the	Stones	live	there,	and	that	if	you
get	the	dancers	to	feel	as	much	as	youâ€™re	feeling	through	the	movements	you
give	them,	the	Jaggerverse	will	shimmer	into	existence,	and	youâ€™ll	suddenly
find	yourself	living	a	Bohemian	existence	downtown.
Grossmont	is	your	third	high	school.	No	one	there	knows	that	less	than	a	year
ago,	you	dropped	out	of	your	second	high	school	and	moved	to	Europe	to
become	a	classical	ballet	dancerâ€”and	that	you	came	home	six	weeks	later
because	your	father	died	of	a	heart	attack.	When	it	happened	your	stepmother
got	you	a	ticket	homeâ€”for	the	funeral,	you	thought.	You	fully	expected	to
return	to	Europe	to	keep	dancing,	but	your	stepmother	talked	you	into	staying	in
California	and	finishing	high	school.	Which	seemed	like	the	sensible	thing	to
do	at	the	time.	But	later	on	you	find	out	that	Mrs.	Newman,	your	stateside	ballet
teacher,	didnâ€™t	think	it	was	such	a	good	idea.	She	felt	like	youâ€™d	lose	your
chance	to	become	really	good.	But	she	never	got	the	chance	to	speak	to	you]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[before	you	got	on	the	plane.
So	after	your	dad	died	you	stayed	in	America,	but	like	Mrs.	Newman,	you
worried	that	you	had	just	killed	your	dancing	careerâ€”because	dancers	start
young,	and	they	also	stop	young.	Most	dancing	careers	end	by	the	time	the
dancers	reach	their	mid-thirties.
Your	stepmother	moved	your	family	to	La	Mesa,	where	you	went	to
Grossmont,	and	thatâ€™s	where	you	are	when	this	picture	is	taken.	Youâ€™ve	found	a
great	studio,	where	you	take	every	class	you	can,	starting	with	the	baby	class
and	ending	at	nine	at	night.	You	come	home	from	hours	of	practice	so
exhausted	that	you	step	into	the	shower	in	your	leotard	and	tights,	lean	against
the	tile,	and	fall	asleep.	You	stretch	your	legs	over	your	head	and	hook	your
toes	under	the	lip	of	your	headboard	and	lie	like	that	for	hours.
And	you	keep	listening,	endlessly,	to	â€œLady	Jane,â€	choreographing	it	in	your
head.	And	one	day,	your	stepmother	sees	tears	streaming	down	your	face,	and
asks	you	why	youâ€™re	crying.
â€œItâ€™s	the	music.	Itâ€™s	so	beautiful,â€	you	say.
She	gives	you	a	classic	what	the	hell?	stare.	What	you	have	said	is	not
computing	in	her	mind.
â€œIf	it	makes	you	cry,â€	she	asks,	â€œwhy	do	you	listen	to	it?â€
Sheâ€™s	genuinely	bewildered,	and	you	wonder	if	itâ€™s	weird	to	cry	when	listening
to	beautiful	music.	You	try	to	remember	if	anyone	in	ballet	school	in	Germany
cried	like	that.	But	in	Germany,	you	guys	were	completely	focused	on	your
training,	and	afterward,	those	crazy	kids	spoke	to	each	other	in	a	language	that
was	not	English.	You,	being	a	Californian,	opted	for	Spanish	as	your	World
Language	(that	is,	before	you	dropped	out	of	school).	So	as	far	as	you	know,	no
one	in	your	Balletthochschule	ever	sobbed	along	to	Brian	Jonesâ€™s	dulcimer
track.
In	this	time	of	uncertainty,	your	stepmother	adds	that	dancers	never	make	any
money	and	they	get	injured	all	the	time.	She	says	that	when	the	injuries	are	bad
enough	they	end	up	teaching	classes	at	the	YMCA.
And	so,	in	this	picture	of	you	at	the	gym,	you	are,	frankly,	falling	apart.	Youâ€™re
worried	about	getting	injured	and	winding	up	at	the	YMCA	(where	you	already
have	a	job	for	the	summer).	Youâ€™re	stressing	that	you	and	your	dancers	wonâ€™t
be	able	to	dance	the	Jaggerverse	into	reality,	and	youâ€™re	worried	that	worrying
about	it	means	youâ€™re	psycho.	Because	that	is	weird,	right?]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Then	the	coolest	thing	happens:	a	big,	tall,	muscular	guy	starts	taking	classes	at
your	studio.	Heâ€™s	a	dance	major	in	college	and	even	though	heâ€™s	a	modern
dancer	(not	a	ballet	dancer,	which	you	think	is	clearly	superior),	you	two	hook
up.	Yeah,	heâ€™s	a	little	older.	But	he	gives	you	books	to	read	and	music	to	listen
to	and	your	stepmother	is	about	to	lose	her	mind	because	heâ€™s	the	closest	thing
around	to	Mick	Jagger.	That	is	to	say,	heâ€™s	got	a	real	edge.	He	tells	you	about
this	â€œprojectâ€	he	did	where	he	danced	around	for	a	while	wearing	a	raincoat,
then	climbed	into	a	barrel	while	another	dancer	poured	gallons	of	milk	over	his
head	and	then	added	several	boxes	of	cornflakes.	You	think	this	is	a	little	bit
random	(okay,	a	lot),	but	the	fact	that	he	could	even	come	up	with	something
like	this	and,	moreover,	get	the	school	to	let	him	do	it	sends	you	soaring.
Plus,	he	partners	you	in	classical	ballet	at	the	studio.	Youâ€™ve	never	gotten	to
dance	with	a	guy	before,	and	it	turns	out	that	you	totally	light	up	the	room	when
you	leap	into	his	arms	and	do	a	fish	dive	(sorry,	thatâ€™s	the	technical	term)	and
then,	after	class,	you	two	drive	to	Balboa	Park	and	make	out	in	the	Organ
Pavilion.	(The	unfortunate	double	entendre	doesnâ€™t	register	at	the	time.)	And
your	ballet	teacher	(Russian,	strict,	and,	apparently,	very	romantic)	tells	you
that	you	should	marry	this	boy.
Which	would	be	another	way	of	dropping	out	of	high	school;	but	your	man-
dancer	is	not	asking	and,	in	fact,	he	leaves	after	a	while	because	heâ€™s
transferring	to	a	new	college.
So	now	youâ€™re	losing	the	Cornflake	King	of	the	dance	world,	the	only	person
youâ€™ve	ever	told	about	your	attempt	to	conjure	the	Jaggerverse	into	reality	with
smokinâ€™	choreography.	And	your	heart	aches	when	he	makes	his	dramatic	exit
like	someone	in	The	Black	Swan.	Youâ€™ve	always	known	in	the	back	of	your
mind	that	heâ€™s	older	and	that	because	youâ€™re	so	angsty	and	conflicted,	you	feel
like	you	canâ€™t	hold	your	own	against	a	mature	dancer	like	him.	(Even	if	he	is
just	a	modern	dancer.)
So	here	you	are	in	the	picture,	your	blood	practically	curdling	with	anxiety,	and
whatever	I	say	to	you	right	now	will	probably	sound	like	a	lecture.	Except	this:
dance	your	dang	fool	heart	out,	girl.	Because	as	of	this	writing,	Mick	Jagger	is
still	alive,	and	so	are	you.	Beautiful	music	makes	you	cry,	and	you	know	some
great	people	who	totally	get	that.	And	between	this	pictureâ€™s	now	and	the	now
of	the	future,	youâ€™re	going	to	conjure	a	lot	of	cool	universes.
And,	just	for	the	record,	I	listened	to	â€œLady	Janeâ€	thirty-two	times	in	a	row
while	writing	you	this	letter.	And	it	was	amazing.]]></text>

CONTINUUM	VS.	BOYS
K.	A.	Holt
Dear	Teen	Me,
Hi!	Itâ€™s	your	thirty-six-year-old	self.	What?!	I	know!	(Good	news:	You	finally
have	boobs.	Bad	news:	Thatâ€™s	not	what	I	want	to	talk	to	you	about.)
I	want	to	tear	your	attention	away	from	whatever	poem	youâ€™re	writing,	or	world
crisis	youâ€™re	trying	to	solve,	and	I	want	to	address	something	moreâ€¦personal.
Iâ€™m	going	to	show	you	a	list	and	see	if	you	can	figure	out	what	the	common
ingredient	is:
Writing.	Books.	Drinking	coffee.	Sleeping	all	day	on	Saturdays.	Studying	art.
Trying	to	create	a	rip	in	the	space-time	continuum	by	figuring	out	the	meaning
of	life.	Listening	to	loud	music.	Going	to	plays.	Making	lists.
See	what	they	have	in	common?
Yes.
Thatâ€™s	right.
Those	are	all	things	you	enjoy	more	than	dating.
I	just	wanted	to	send	you	this	note	(although	the	technology	that	I	used	is	a
secret,	trust	me:	It	wonâ€™t	do	any	harm	to	the	space-time	continuum)	to	let	you
know	that	this	is	100	percent	completely	okay.	Just	because	youâ€™re	a	teenager
doesnâ€™t	mean	you	have	to	be	boy-crazy.	Your	best	friend	might	have	a	different
boyfriend	every	two	weeks	and	spend	every	spare	second	making	out	in	the
halls	at	school,	but	this	doesnâ€™t	mean	you	have	to	do	the	same	thing.	And	I
know	it	seems	like	every	movie	you	see	has	a	girl	pining	for	a	boy,	but	that
doesnâ€™t	mean	you	have	to,	too.	I	promise.
Boys	can	be	great.	You	know	that.	Theyâ€™re	funny	and	smart	and	nice	to	talk	to.
You	like	how	their	hands	look,	and	sometimes	you	wonder	what	it	would	be
like	to	sniff	the	backs	of	their	necks.	HOWEVER,	this	doesnâ€™t	mean	you	need

P.	J.	Hoover
Dear	Teen	Me,
Isnâ€™t	it	cute	how	people	call	you	â€œTrish	the	Dish?â€	Yes,	itâ€™s	totally	flattering,
and	Iâ€™m	glad	you	own	it.	If	youâ€™re	going	to	have	a	nickname,	one	that	makes
you	out	to	be	an	attractive	female	is	choice.	I	mean,	itâ€™s	way	better	than	â€œphat.â€
No	matter	how	much	explanation	is	given,	that	one	never	sounds	good.
In	case	you	donâ€™t	know,	I	think	youâ€™re	fantastic.	In	lots	of	ways,	I	wish	I	were
more	like	you.	From	your	confidence	to	your	intelligence	(hello,	math
superstar!),	and	especially	the	way	you	plan	for	the	future	yet	live	for	the
moment,	youâ€™re	amazing.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing.	Youâ€™re	letting	something	sneak
in.	Something	you	arenâ€™t	even	aware	of.	Itâ€™s	slipping	in	through	the	cracks,	but
itâ€™s	like	venom,	and	itâ€™s	poisoning	your	mind.	Here,	from	the	future,	itâ€™s	so
obvious,	but	you	just	donâ€™t	see	it.	You	never	have.	I	wish	I	could	make	it	stop,
because,	despite	all	the	awesome	things	you	accomplish	in	your	life,	this	is	the
single	thing	thatâ€™s	caused	you	the	most	unhappiness	and	distress.
It	starts	small.	Your	dance	instructor	mentions	youâ€™ve	gained	ten	pounds	in	the
last	year	(puberty	anyone?).	A	male	classmate	mentions	some	other	girl	has	a
nicer	figure	than	you	(obviously	not	a	choice	male	specimen).	Your	pants	fit	a
bit	snug,	and	a	â€œfriendâ€	feels	inclined	to	mention	this	to	you	(le	sigh.	Why	must
people	feel	so	inclined?).	These	little	bits	and	pieces	wedge	their	way	into	your
psyche.
The	first	time	you	go	on	a	true	diet,	you	see	success.	You	see	how	the	less	you
put	in	your	mouth,	the	more	weight	you	lose.	Itâ€™s	simple	mathematics,	and
youâ€™ve	always	been	great	at	math.	Remember,	itâ€™s	one	of	the	things	I	love	about
you.	So	you	start	experimenting	with	eating,	binging	and	purging	and	starving
and	compulsively	exercising,	and	from	there	itâ€™s	all	downhill.
I	wish	I	could	give	you	better	news.	But	the	sad	fact	of	the	matter	is	that	you
plunge	into	a	dark	realm	of	anorexic	and	bulimic	habits	that	stays	in	full	swing
for	the	better	part	of	seven	years.	You	try	everything.	First,	you	donâ€™t	eat.	Like
anything.	And	yes,	the	weight	comes	off.	But	you	almost	pass	out	when	you]]></text>

Ellen	Hopkins
Dear	Teen	Me,
Your	life	was	unusual	from	the	start.	You	were	adopted	at	birth.	Your	mother
was	forty-two	when	you	were	born,	the	â€œMayâ€	to	your	fatherâ€™s	â€œDecember.â€	He
was	seventy-two,	and	to	put	that	into	perspective,	he	was	born	in	1883.	The	son
of	German	immigrants	and	the	definition	of	a	â€œself-made	man,â€	your	dad
parlayed	a	sixth-grade	education	into	a	couple	of	thriving	businesses.	He	made
his	million	dollars	not	long	before	he	brought	nine-day-old	you	home	to	a
beautiful	Spanish-style	house	in	Palm	Springs,	California.	Comedian	Bob	Hope
lived	next	door	and,	having	adopted	a	slew	of	kids	himself,	he	sent	his	nanny
over	to	help	out	for	a	few	days.	You	were,	of	course,	much	too	young	to
appreciate	this.	But	letâ€™s	just	say	that	few	enough	people	are	given	such	an
auspicious	beginning.
The	truth	is,	you	were	a	child	of	privilege.	Not	so	much	because	of	money
(though	you	never	went	without),	but	because	of	a	very	large	measure	of	love
infusing	your	childhood.	You	were	doted	on,	and	while	your	parentsâ€™	age
denied	activities	some	families	sharedâ€”skiing	or	mountain	biking,	for	instance
â€”your	mom	and	dad	rewarded	you	with	things	many	children	never	have.	You
took	piano	and	voice	lessons.	Studied	danceâ€”ballet,	tap,	jazz,	even	hula.	You
had	dogs,	cats,	canaries,	a	lizard	or	two.	You	owned	horses	and	rode	fearlessly
â€”barefoot,	bare-headed,	and	barebackâ€”across	the	desert	and	into	the	hills.
Your	mother	read	to	you	every	day,	taught	you	to	read	on	your	own	before	you
even	started	kindergarten.	From	her,	you	developed	an	ear	for	language	and	a
passion	for	classic	literature	and	poetry.	Your	father	was	no	Puritan,	but	he
wanted	you	to	have	faith,	and	made	sure	you	went	to	church	every	Sunday.
From	him,	you	learned	the	value	of	honesty	and	hard	work.	A	favorite	saying	of
his	stuck	with	you:	Anything	worth	doing	is	worth	doing	right.
You	went	to	a	great	private	school,	where	creative	teachers	encouraged	your
talents.	You	excelled	at	academics,	especially	anything	English	or	writing-
related.	You	published	a	poem	when	you	were	just	nine.	Won	trophies	for	your
equestrian	skills,	ribbons	at	track	meets.	You	aced	piano	recitals	and	dance]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[competitions.	By	anyoneâ€™s	measure,	these	were	successes.	Yet,	somehow,	you
grew	up	feelingâ€¦not	good	enough.
This	probably	took	root	in	the	knowledge	that	you	were	given	away	as	a	baby.
Your	parents	were	friends	with	the	doctor	who	arranged	the	adoption.	Curious
about	where	you	came	from,	when	you	were	five	you	eavesdropped	on	one	of
their	conversations	and	heard	the	doctor	say,	â€œEllen	isnâ€™t	nearly	as	pretty	as	[her
half-sister].â€	Later,	you	understood	your	birth	mother	was	only	sixteen,
unmarried,	and	unequipped	to	parent.	But	as	a	small	child,	the	message	seemed
clear:	Not	pretty	enough	equaled	unworthy.	Your	birth	mother	kept	her	other
daughter.	She	rejected	you.	You	stashed	that	away,	in	a	cabinet	deep	inside	you,
and	there	it	will	stay	into	adulthood.
Elementary	school	was	your	â€œchubbyâ€	phase.	The	kids	would	chant	â€œElsie	the
Cow,â€	followed	by	a	rousing	chorus	of	moos.	And	though	you	shed	those	few
extra	pounds	before	seventh	grade,	the	mirror	will	always	reflect	a	fat	girl.	Not
thin	enough	meant	unlikeable.	In	a	way,	you	denied	yourself.	The	Guernsey
goes	into	the	internal	cupboard,	too.
So	now	youâ€™re	a	teen.	Moving	to	a	small	town	the	summer	before	your	eighth
grade	year	means	starting	high	school	as	the	quintessential	new	kid.	Just	about
everyone	else	here	has	been	friends	since	kindergarten,	but	you	donâ€™t	know
anyone.	That	puts	you	on	the	perimeter	of	some	tightly	closed	circles,	trying	to
push	your	way	inside.	Outsiders	rarely	reach	â€œin	crowdâ€	status,	and	no	matter
how	nice	you	are	to	the	cheerleaders,	you	are	no	exception.	Instead,	you	find
acceptance	among	the	intelligentsia,	artistes,	and	anti-establishmentarians.	In
other	words,	the	stoners.
And	then,	when	youâ€™re	sixteen,	your	father	dies.	Suddenly,	you	have	to	grow	up
very	quickly,	to	help	your	mother	deal	with	a	funeral,	probate,	death	taxes.	You
do	everything	you	can	to	ease	the	process,	but	she	falls	into	a	deep	depression,
closes	herself	off	from	everyone,	including	you.	You	try	your	best	to
understand	why,	and	on	some	level,	you	do.	But	itâ€™s	yet	another	rebuff,	and	this
time,	from	the	person	youâ€™re	closest	to.
So	maybe	it	isnâ€™t	surprising	that	you	look	to	boys	for	approval.	Not	that	youâ€™re
easy.	Your	Lutheran	upbringing	has	given	you	a	solid	moral	compass.	Youâ€™re
not	interested	in	casual	sex.	What	you	want	is	someone	who	loves	you.
Someone	who	makes	you	feel	like	you	are	the	most	special	girl	in	the	world.
You	definitely	connect	with	a	few	guys,	but	high	school	romances	tend	to	be
short-lived.	With	each	breakup,	you	leak	a	little	more	self-esteem.]]></text>

Smart.	Pretty	much	geek-smart,	and	who	wants	to	hang	out	with	a	geek?
Plain.	Youâ€™ll	never	be	pretty,	so	why	bother	with	makeup?	It	canâ€™t	hide	the	big
bump	in	your	nose.	And	forget	about	top-rung	boyfriends.	Theyâ€™re	looking	for
glitzier	girls.
Fat.	The	best	part	about	that	is	not	having	to	worry	about	cute	clothes.	Jeans
and	baggy	T-shirts	will	do.
Decent	at	dance,	choir,	drama.	To	a	degree.	You	donâ€™t	get	solos	or	leads.	And
you	didnâ€™t	make	the	cheer	squad.
Different.	Youâ€™ll	never	fit	into	mainstream	cliques.	Plus,	you	have	this
annoying	habit	of	making	friends	with	other	kids	who	are	different,	too.	Which
pushes	you	even	closer	toward	freak	distinction.
Probable	yearbook	description:	Most	Likely	to	Be	Rejected.
Chin	up.	You	wonâ€™t	know	this	for	a	very	long	time	(when	you	reconnect	with
your	old	classmates	through	something	called	Facebook),	but	this	is	how	other
people	see	you:	Smart.	Reliable.	Youâ€™re	the	one	cheaters	want	to	sit	behind	on
test	day.	Youâ€™ll	ace	your	SATs	and	get	into	the	college	of	your	choice.
Pretty.	You	have	a	natural	beauty	that	doesnâ€™t	rely	on	makeup.	Donâ€™t	worry
about	your	nose.	No	one	notices	it.	Theyâ€™re	looking	at	your	smile.
Fit.	Between	dance,	track,	and	horseback	riding,	youâ€™ve	got	amazing	legs	and	a
great	rear	end.	These	are	things	no	amount	of	dieting	can	achieve.
Talented.	You	continue	to	publish	poetry	and	win	every	creative	writing	contest
you	enter.	And	you	sure	know	how	to	rock	â€˜nâ€™	roll.
Different.	You	are	sensitive	and	more	caring	than	most.	You	are	a	rebel,	and
speak	your	mind,	especially	about	inequalities	you	see.	You	are	brave.
Probable	yearbook	description:	Most	Likely	to	Take	a	Stand.
You	graduate	near	the	top	of	your	class.	Tossing	that	tasseled	cap	feels	like	the
first	step	toward	freedom.	It	is	a	sprint	toward	adulthood,	where	life	will	be	just
as	confusing	as	ever.	Youâ€™ll	drop	out	of	college,	choose	the	wrong	guys.	A
couple	will	hurt	you,	and	one	will	abuse	you.	Trust	will	come	harder	and
harder.	But	each	wrong	turn	makes	you	wiser.	After	a	while	youâ€™ll	realize	that
love	isnâ€™t	about	control.	Itâ€™s	about	mutual	respect.	Long-term	relationships	are

Eventually,	you	find	forever	connection	with	an	amazing	man.	One	who
embraces	you,	and	the	responsibilities	of	a	ready-made	family.	Yes,	youâ€™ll	have
three	children,	one	of	whom	will	be	responsible	for	an	earthquake	of	pain.	But
youâ€™ll	survive	this	heartbreak,	too,	and	not	only	does	it	make	you	stronger,	it
puts	you	on	the	path	you	donâ€™t	yet	know	youâ€™re	searching	for.	(Iâ€™ll	give	you	a
hint:	Keep	writing	poetry.)	You	will	parent	a	fourth	child,	too.	Full	circle,
youâ€™ll	adopt	him	when	you	are	forty-two,	the	exact	same	age	your	mother	was
when	she	adopted	you.	And,	full	circle,	he	will	be	bullied	and	struggle	with
feeling	different.	Being	adopted	has	that	effect.	But	youâ€™ve	been	there,	and
recognize	the	emotions	he	experiences.	You	will	help	him	grow	into	a	brilliant
young	man,	in	part	because	of	the	things	you	have	been	through	yourself.	Your
past	helps	create	his	future.
What	I	wish	you	could	understand,	teen	me,	is	that	the	past	does	create	the
future.	Everything	that	sets	you	apart	also	makes	you	unique.	You	are	finding	a
distinctive	voice,	and	one	day	that	voice	will	speak	not	only	to	many,	but	also
for	many	who	canâ€™t	speak	for	themselves.	All	that	rejection	helps	you	grow	a
thick	skin,	one	youâ€™ll	need	when	you	finally	settle	into	the	career	you	were
destined	for.	Being	pushed	away	makes	you	want	to	gather	others	in.	And	you
will,	in	ways	small	and	immense.
Of	course,	if	you	suspected	any	of	this	now,	you	might	just	crawl	into	your
closet	and	stay	there,	where	itâ€™s	private.	Cozy.	Safe.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	Life
isnâ€™t	always	safe.	It	isnâ€™t	always	happy	or	pretty	or	neat.	Sometimes	itâ€™s
downright	sad	and	ugly	and	messy.	Dangerous,	even.	You	have	to	take	risks	to
discover	courage.	You	must	know	pain	to	understand	the	true	meaning	of	joy.
And	only	through	experiencing	the	sting	of	death	will	you	come	to	cherish
living.
You	will	make	mistakes.	Everyone	does.	Accept	thatâ€”no,	value	thatâ€”and
keep	moving	forward.	I	promise,	in	the	future	youâ€™ll	look	back	and	decide	you
wouldnâ€™t	change	a	thing.	Each	misstep,	each	sidestep,	each	baby	step	brings
you	one	step	closer	to	where	you	belong,	and	once	you	reach	this	place,	every
day	will	bring	immense	satisfaction.
Dearest	Teen	Ellen.	You	were	unusual	from	the	start.	Each	inimitable	day	of
your	life	helps	create	a	voice	completely	your	own.]]></text>

your	car,	and	sometimes	you	get	a	few	hundred	miles	into	running	away	before
you	come	back.
Sometimes	you	want	to	talk	to	an	adult	about	how	alienated	and	confused	you
feel,	but	youâ€™re	afraid	your	parents	and	teachers	and	church	leaders	will	hate
you.	You	have	a	wonderful	family,	a	solid	community,	and	people	who	support
your	artsy-fartsy	tendencies	and	think	youâ€™ve	got	potential,	kid.	You	donâ€™t	think
you	deserve	to	be	so	miserable.
But	misery	isnâ€™t	something	you	have	to	earn.	Misery	is	misery.	It	just	is.	I	know

Carrie	Jones
Dear	Teen	Me,
Okay,	a	lot	of	people	write	about	their	health	problems.	And	I	get	that.	I	mean,
a	lot	of	people	like	to	talk	about	their	broken	bones	and	gastrointestinal	issues,
and	whatever.	Thatâ€™s	fine.	During	flu	season,	people	will	go	into	graphic	details
about	how	they	puked	every	two	minutes.	Theyâ€™ll	even	revel	in	details	about
the	consistency	of	their	vomitâ€”and	trust	me,	whether	it	was	acidic	or	chunky,
it	was	definitely	gross.
Youâ€™ve	never	been	one	of	those	people,	though.	Itâ€™s	not	that	you	think	sickness
shows	some	kind	of	bodily	or	spiritual	weakness	or	something	like	that.	You
just	think	itâ€™s	boring.	And	as	far	as	youâ€™re	concerned,	thereâ€™s	nothing	worse
than	being	boring.
So	when	you	were	super	little	and	broke	your	ankle	playing	tag	at	Debbie
Muirâ€™s	house,	you	didnâ€™t	talk	about	it.	And	when	you	were	in	second	grade	and
you	broke	your	front	tooth,	you	didnâ€™t	talk	about	that	either.	You	even	kept
your	chronic	bronchitis	a	secret.
And	now?
I	guess	the	older	youâ€”that	is	to	say,	meâ€”is	sticking	to	the	plan.	Because
writing	isnâ€™t	talking,	technically	speaking.	But	I	still	feel	this	weird	sort	of
apprehension,	of	nervousness.	A	little	voice	inside	my	head	keeps	telling	me,
â€œSickness	is	boring.	Tell	a	joke,	Carrie.	Tell	a	joke.â€
But	seizure	jokes	are	terrible,	evil	things.	These	are	from	Epilepsy.com:
Do	you	know	what	to	do	if	someone	has	a	seizure	in	a	swimming	pool?
Throw	in	the	laundry.
Whatâ€™s	blue	and	doesnâ€™t	fit.	A	dead	epileptic.
There	are	some	that	are	even	worse,	but	Iâ€™m	not	going	to	include	them	here
because	Iâ€™m	nice	like	that.	So,	youâ€™re	probably	wondering	why	Iâ€™m	even	telling]]></text>

boy,	and	so	that	you	wouldnâ€™t	have	to	suffer	through	seizures	every	day	of	your
freshman	year.	But	I	canâ€™t	tell	you	that.	Things	donâ€™t	work	that	way.
Other	things	that	are	unpredictable:
1.	Boys	at	parties.
	
2.	Your	friends	at	parties	when	your	friends	are	wasted.
	
3.	Seizures.
So,	um,	the	points	here	are:
1.	Youâ€™re	about	to	experience	something	truly	awful.	Even	though	you	donâ€™t
drink,	a	certain	very	cruel,	very	callous	guy	is	drinkingâ€”and	thereâ€™s

giving	you	seizures.
	
3.	Do	not	give	up.
Seriously.	Thatâ€™s	the	point.	DO	NOT	GIVE	UP.	Youâ€™re	going	to	have	seizures.
You	are	actually	going	to	develop	a	rash	as	a	result	of	those	seizures.	The	rash
is	pretty	gross.	Pack	a	lot	of	tights	and	pants	to	hide	it.	The	seizures	will	start
with	your	hand	jerking.	Then	youâ€™ll	pass	out.
At	one	point	youâ€™ll	pass	out	when	youâ€™re	near	a	cute	boy	in	your	philosophy
class.	Heâ€™ll	try	not	to	panic,	but	heâ€™ll	also	kind	of	fail.	At	another	point	youâ€™ll
pass	out	in	your	dorm	room.	And	once,	you	even	wind	up	falling	off	a	ladder	at
your	Othello	rehearsal.	Sometimes	youâ€™ll	hit	your	head.	Sometimes	youâ€™ll	wind
up	with	so	many	bruises	that	people	will	think	youâ€™re	being	abused.
Sometimes	people	will	say,	â€œHey,	arenâ€™t	you	the	girl	who	hasâ€¦â€
Theyâ€™ll	search	for	an	inoffensive	word.	Theyâ€™ll	usually	find	it.	And	you,	for
your	part,	will	usually	just	be	honest	and	answer	yes.	And	a	lot	of	those
awesome	people	at	Bates	College	wonâ€™t	care	at	all.	Theyâ€™ll	still	love	you
despite	the	fact	that	youâ€™ve	lost	IQ	points	from	all	the	seizures.
Yes,	Carrie,	there	will	be	cognitive	degeneration.	Yes,	Carrie,	that	means	you
wonâ€™t	be	able	to	recall	recent	conversations	that	well	anymore,	or	class	lectures,
and	youâ€™ll	actually	have	to	study.
Hereâ€™s	the	thing:	Your	sickness	isnâ€™t	important.	Itâ€™s	not	going	to	define	who
you	are.	You	have	to	be	the	one	to	do	that.
Your	first	seizure	will	happen	at	home.	You	and	Joe	are	hanging	on	the	floor,
watching	Amazon	Women	on	the	Moonâ€”this	spoof	movie	that	makes	fun	of
other	movies	and	shows.	Itâ€™s	sort	of	a	bunch	of	weird	skits	that	feature	things
like	a	hero	guy	fighting	against	giant	spiders,	and	a	first	lady	who	used	to	be	a
hooker.	Stuff	like	that.
You	arenâ€™t	feeling	great.	You	think	itâ€™s	the	stress.	A	half-eaten	tray	of	nachos
rests	on	the	heavy	wooden	coffee	table	in	front	of	you.	About	four	cans	of	Pepsi
linger	around	the	nachos,	flip	tops	open,	and	almost	drained.]]></text>

He	loves	the	scene	where	a	bunch	of	naked	women	walk	around	doing
completely	normal	things.	Itâ€™s	his	favorite	scene	in	the	movie.
â€œYeah.	Me	too.â€	You	stop	and	correct	yourself.	â€œI	mean,	Iâ€™m	going	to	miss
you.â€
You	scratch	at	the	weird	rash	down	by	your	ankle.	Itâ€™s	a	bizarre	array	of	red
dots	and	circles.	It	isnâ€™t	bright;	just	sort	of	looks	like	faded	markers.	You	hate	it
because	it	makes	you	imperfect.	You	also	hate	the	idea	of	leaving	Joe,	even
though	youâ€™re	super	psyched	about	the	future	right	now,	and	about	getting	out
of	the	split-level	house	with	the	ugly	brown	couch.	Youâ€™re	ready	to	leave	the
entire	town	of	Bedford,	New	Hampshire,	behindâ€”because	it	seems	to	be
nothing	but	rich	people	(except,	that	is,	for	you).
Joe	is	the	â€œyounger	manâ€â€”which	sounds	pretty	naughty,	but	isnâ€™t.	Heâ€™s	a	year
behind	you	in	school	though,	so	youâ€™ll	be	going	to	college	first.
And	because	itâ€™s	one	of	the	weaker	scenes	in	the	movie,	and	because,	even
though	something	awful	happened	at	that	party,	you	and	Joe	are	hormonal
monsters,	you	start	to	make	out.	Kissing	Joe	is	like	kissing	sunlight.	It	energizes
you,	makes	you	all	shaky	inside,	like	youâ€™re	doped	up	on	a	caffeine	IV	or
something	crazy	like	that.	When	you	kiss	him,	you	can	smell	him,	and	he
smells	clean,	like	white	soap	and	Lubriderm	moisturizer	(which	claims	to	be
fragrance-free	but	totally	smells).	Your	lips	seem	like	theyâ€™re	magnetized,	like
they	canâ€™t	help	but	be	drawn	toward	his,	and	everything	is	right	in	the	worldâ€¦
until	IT	happens.	Youâ€™re	inhaling	that	smell	when	he	breaks	away	and	says,
â€œYour	lips	are	kind	of	dry.â€
â€œOh!â€	you	grab	for	your	Pepsi.	â€œSorry!â€
You	remember	taking	a	sipâ€¦holding	the	canâ€¦hand	shaking	in	this	weird,
rhythmical	wayâ€¦Joe	grabbing	the	can,	his	eyes	all	soft	and	concernedâ€¦his
voice	sounding	far	away.	â€œYou	okay?â€
Thatâ€™s	all	you	remember.

unfair	treatment	and	discrimination.â€
The	first	step	comes	when	people	realize	that	others	are	different	from
themselves.	They	give	those	differences	â€œlabels.â€	Next,	culture	determines	that

DECISION	TO	LIVE
Mike	Jung
Dear	Teen	Me,
Itâ€™s	good	that	Iâ€™m	sending	you	a	letter	from	here	in	the	future,	because	I	know
itâ€™s	not	likely	youâ€™d	trust	me	if	I	tried	to	talk	to	you	in	person.	You	donâ€™t	trust
many	people,	and	honestly,	why	would	you?	Youâ€™re	fifteen,	and	fifteen,	for
you,	was	a	monstrously	bad	year.	Right	now	you	canâ€™t	even	remember	a	time
when	your	life	wasnâ€™t	all	about	bullies,	bullies,	bulliesâ€”theyâ€™ve	verbally	laid
into	you	every	day	for	the	past	four	years,	and	itâ€™s	gotten	physical	more	than	a
few	times	as	well.	Thatâ€™s	approximately	a	thousand	days	of	hearing	all	the
reasons	why	youâ€™re	such	a	catastrophic	loser:	your	face,	clothes,	skin,	hair,	lack
of	athletic	ability,	fondness	for	role-playing	games,	awkwardness	with	girls,
bookworm	tendencies,	and	ethnicity	are	all	fair	game.
Itâ€™s	also	clear	that	no	help	is	forthcoming.	For	example,	there	was	that	teacher
who	stood	and	watched	through	the	locker	room	window	as	a	cluster	of	bigger
guys	pushed	you	into	a	corner	locker	and	showered	you	with	racist,
homophobic	taunts,	preventing	you	from	getting	dressed	until	the	room	was
emptied	out.	And	the	fact	that	youâ€™re	at	least	a	year	younger	than	everyone	else
in	the	room	doesnâ€™t	make	things	any	easierâ€”your	suspicion	that	your	parents
were	wrong	about	moving	you	up	a	grade	is	192	percent	confirmed.
Yep,	good	times.	There	are	two	years	of	high	school	left	to	goâ€”youâ€™re	looking
at	another	500	days	of	similar	treatmentâ€”but	the	damage	has	already	been
done.	The	bullies	and	critics	have	convinced	you	that	theyâ€™re	right.	You	despise
yourself.
Iâ€™m	genuinely	sorry.	Youâ€™re	in	emotional	agony,	you	feel	desperately	alone,
and	you	canâ€™t	engage	with	the	good	things	and	amazing	people	that	are	actually
there	for	you.	In	fact,	fifteen	is	the	age	when	you	first	truly	consider	the	most
extreme	way	out.	Anger	and	bitternessâ€”at	your	so-called	peers,	at	your	family,
at	the	entire,	unfeeling	universeâ€”nearly	consume	you,	and	in	the	years	to	come
youâ€™ll	spend	more	than	one	sleepless	night	deciding	whether	or	not	to	go	on]]></text>

I	get	it,	you	know?	You	donâ€™t	see	any	other	solution.	But	there	is	another	way
â€”although	itâ€™s	a	hard	one.	You	can	hang	in	there,	deal	with	the	loneliness	and
feelings	of	worthlessness	as	best	you	can,	and	wait	it	out.	You	want	to	get
through	this,	my	friend.	I	know	it	feels	like	things	will	never	change,	but	they
will	(although	in	all	honestly	itâ€™s	going	to	be	a	while	longer).
Youâ€™ll	spend	a	long	string	of	years	coping	with	your	rage,	fleeing	the	black	hole
of	depression,	and	struggling	to	make	yourself	whole	again.	Youâ€™ll	self-
medicate.	You	wonâ€™t	date	very	many	people,	and	when	you	do,	your	decision-
making	will	be,	um,	questionable.	And	every	time	you	see	another	human
being,	youâ€™ll	instinctively	turn	away,	because	nearly	every	person	on	the	planet
looks	like	a	slavering	monster-in-waiting.	But	eventually	youâ€™ll	discover	that
the	seeds	of	compassion,	kindness,	and	generosity	are	still	within	you.	Itâ€™s	very,
very	important	that	you	keep	those	seeds	alive,	because	later	in	life	youâ€™ll
finally	learn	how	to	make	them	grow.
Itâ€™s	not	a	given	that	those	seeds	of	kindness	will	sprout,	you	knowâ€”in	fact,
thereâ€™ll	be	times	when	youâ€™ll	act	in	the	same	brutish,	inexcusable	manner	as
your	tormenters.	Thereâ€™ll	be	an	incident	later	in	your	junior	year	involving	a
guy	in	your	class	who	deals	with	some	of	the	same	treatment	you	do.	The	two
of	you	have	already	spent	a	lot	of	time	trying	to	humiliate	each	other,	which	is
regrettable	on	so,	so	many	levels,	but	one	day	youâ€™ll	go	too	far.	Youâ€™ll	circulate
a	questionnaire	asking	if	this	guy	is	the	worldâ€™s	biggestâ€¦letâ€™s	say	orifice.	Itâ€™ll
be	a	senseless,	stupid	act	of	cruelty,	and	while	you	might	not	deserve	to	be
thrown	headfirst	into	a	wall	(which	is	whatâ€™ll	happenâ€”watch	your	head,	chief),
it	wonâ€™t	be	hard	to	understand	the	intensity	of	his	reaction.	The	goose	egg	on
your	forehead	will	heal,	but	the	loose	thread	in	your	moral	fiber	is	probably	still
there	to	this	day.
Thankfully,	you	wonâ€™t	go	permanently	down	that	road.	Thatâ€™s	not	to	say	you
lack	a	normal	range	of	moronic	tendencies,	or	that	youâ€™ll	never	hurt	anyone
ever	again,	but	after	years	of	soul-searching	and	self-discovery	itâ€™ll	be	possible
to	describe	you	as	a	decent	guy.	I	know,	â€œdecent	guyâ€	lacks	the	high-school
sizzle	of	things	like	â€œrock	star,â€	â€œbabe	magnet,â€	or	â€œparty	animal.â€	Youâ€™ll	never
morph	into	any	of	those	things	(although	youâ€™ll	occasionally	humiliate	the
bejesus	out	of	yourself	in	trying).	Itâ€™s	easy	to	underestimate	the	value	of	being	a
decent	guy,	but	itâ€™s	what	saves	you	in	the	end.

somewhat	broken	at	my	age.	Youâ€™ll	still	struggle	in	group	situations,	commit	an
atrocious	variety	of	social	blunders,	and	second-guess	yourself	on	a	continual
basis.	But	youâ€™ll	also	understand	who	you	are,	accept	who	you	are,	andâ€”

I	know,	youâ€™re	thinking,	â€œBUT	HOW?â€	Iâ€™m	afraid	there	wonâ€™t	be	some	clear-

is	retract	your	extremities	like	a	turtle,	and	seek	refuge	in	creativityâ€”both	other
peopleâ€™s,	and	your	own.
For	example,	thereâ€™s	music.	Being	a	band	geek	isnâ€™t	sufficient	though,	right?	So
instead,	you	become	the	first	male	flutist	at	your	high	school	in	what,	twenty
years?	Itâ€™s	like	writing,	â€œPLEASE	BEAT	ME	SENSELESS,â€	on	your	forehead.
However,	every	so	often,	someone	tells	you	how	much	they	respect	that	choice.
At	your	age,	it	means	nothing	to	hear	that,	but	those	little	comments	are	piling
up	in	your	subconscious.
Youâ€™ll	keep	making	art,	and	for	years	thatâ€™ll	be	your	one	reliable	source	of
validation	from	the	world.	Youâ€™ll	copy	down	hundreds	of	superheroes,
monsters,	and	other	characters	from	pop	culture,	and	then	later	on	youâ€™ll	create
your	own	characters.	Youâ€™ll	still	occasionally	hear	about	the	Turtle	Mafia
decades	later,	for	exampleâ€”one	friend	will	even	remember	that	you	came	up
with	that	before	Teenage	Mutant	Ninja	Turtles.	More	of	those	comments	piling
up,	right?
Youâ€™ll	continue	to	submerge	yourself	in	fantasy,	science	fiction,	horror,	and
comic	books	galore.	Youâ€™ll	absorb	those	books.	You	donâ€™t	even	know	how
much	youâ€™re	learning,	but	the	incessant	reading	and	drawing	will	become	a
thermonuclear	source	of	internalized	storytelling	knowledge.
Eventually	youâ€™ll	hit	this	sweet	spot	where	people	actually	want	to	hear	your
stories!	Itâ€™ll	make	all	the	difference.	Youâ€™ll	always	struggle	to	build
relationships,	but	there	are	people	youâ€™ll	love,	and	whoâ€™ll	love	you	back.
Sometimes	itâ€™ll	be	complicated,	or	painful,	or	just	plain	weird,	but	other	times
itâ€™ll	be	glorious.	On	some	days	youâ€™ll	feel	the	weight	of	lifeâ€™s	cruelty	and
unfairness,	and	youâ€™ll	shrug	it	off,	because	the	different	kinds	of	love	youâ€™ll	feel
for	so	many	people	will	propel	you	forward	like	psychological	rocket	fuel.
Youâ€™ll	love	your	wife	and	children	above	all,	but	youâ€™ll	also	love	the	friends
you	make	in	all	areas	of	life,	especially	in	the	world	of	childrenâ€™s	literature.

Stasia	Ward	Kehoe
Dear	Teen	Me,
As	I	write	this	letter,	you	have	kids	of	your	own.	I	know,	right	now	youâ€™re
telling	everyone	that	youâ€™re	an	artist,	swearing	that	youâ€™ll	never	marry	or	have
children.	But	thereâ€™ll	be	a	guy	who	changes	that	plan.	Meanwhile,	youâ€™ll	bury
yourself	in	dance	and	theater,	pretending	youâ€™re	too	busy	for	boys.	Really,
youâ€™re	afraid	of	them.	In	fact,	youâ€™re	afraid	of	so	many	things	that	I	sometimes
wonder	how	you	let	your	friend	Aimee	drag	you	to	that	frat	party.	Itâ€™s	probably
because	you	were	afraid	to	lose	Aimee,	whoâ€™s	one	of	your	few	reliable	friends.
So	now	youâ€™re	standing	by	the	living	room	fireplace	on	Greek	Row.	The	music
pounds	through	the	floorboards,	and	then	up	your	legs	and	into	your	frantic
heart.	Even	if	Aimee	hadnâ€™t	disappeared	into	the	crowd,	there	would	still	be	no
way	for	you	to	talk	to	anyone	here.	You	stand	still,	afraid	to	even	sip	the	punch
(which	smells	more	like	acne	medicine	than	fruit	juice).
Youâ€™re	about	to	go	sit	out	the	rest	of	this	miserable	night	on	the	front	porch
when	Joe,	the	boy	Aimee	had	come	to	flirt	with,	approaches	you.	He	leans	his
arm	against	the	chimney,	shielding	you	from	the	frenzy.	He	says	something
about	getting	away	from	the	chaos.	You	nod	because	you	donâ€™t	like	crowds
either,	and	Joe	invites	you	to	his	room.
You	want	to	get	away	from	the	party	so	badly	that	you	actually	think	Joeâ€™s
bedroom	is	preferable	to	the	front	stoop.	And	you	justify	your	lapse	in	judgment
by	blaming	Aimee	for	ditching	you	first.	What	you	donâ€™t	see	now	is	that	your
biggest	fearâ€”even	worse	than	boysâ€”is	of	being	lonely.
With	barely	a	word,	Joe	leads	you	past	the	desk	to	his	bed,	directing	you	onto
your	back	by	pointing	out	the	glow-in-the-dark	stars	on	the	ceiling.	In	the	dim,
quiet	room,	he	starts	kissing	you.	He	tugs	your	tank	top	down,	staring,	while
you	feel	about	as	romanced	as	a	frog	on	a	dissecting	table.	When	Joe	gets	up,
muttering,	â€œIâ€™ll	be	right	back,â€	your	brain	finally	kicks	into	gear.	You	fix	your
shirt,	find	the	door,	and	run	straight	to	Aimeeâ€™s	car.	Youâ€™re	still	there,
shivering,	when	she	turns	up	an	hour	later,	saying	that	she	never	found	Joe.]]></text>

Instead,	you	swallow	the	shame	of	that	night,	flashing	back	to	the	image	of	your
exposed	breasts,	white	in	the	fluorescent	plastic	starlight,	again	and	again.	You
keep	Aimee	as	your	friend	by	nodding,	agreeing,	and	keeping	quiet	for	the	rest
of	high	school.
This	is	not	the	last	time	youâ€™ll	make	a	bad	judgment	call.	There	will	be	other
Joes.	Youâ€™ll	spend	several	more	years	behind	your	angsty,	artsy	mask	before
youâ€™re	able	to	openly	admit	how	lonely	and	afraid	you	are.
Youâ€™re	going	to	find	your	way	eventually,	but	if	it	were	possible,	I	wish	I	could
help	you	be	more	confident	now.	Have	the	courage	to	say	yes	to	a	year	of	study

Tara	Kelly
Dear	Teen	Me,
You	meet	her	your	freshman	year.	Youâ€™re	the	awkward	new	kid	who	dresses
like	a	goth	one	day	and	like	your	mother	the	next.	Sheâ€™s	the	â€œschool	slut,â€	the
kind	of	girl	every	other	girl	warns	you	about.	But	sheâ€™ll	be	the	first	person	to
reach	out	to	youâ€¦the	only	person.
Sheâ€™s	not	the	most	beautiful	girl	youâ€™ve	ever	seen,	but	everyone	notices	her.	Itâ€™s
not	her	clothes.	She	dresses	like	a	lot	of	girls,	vintage	jeans	and	baby	tees	with	a
logo	or	a	slogan	across	the	chest.	Itâ€™s	not	her	sunshine	hair	or	her	scarlet
lipstick.	Itâ€™s	not	even	her	voice,	rough	and	sweet	at	the	same	time.	Itâ€™s	the
unconscious	things,	the	little	things.	The	way	her	lips	are	always	turned	up.	The
sway	of	her	hips.	The	look	in	her	eyesâ€”sheâ€™s	seen	enough	life	for	someone
twice	her	age.
The	two	of	you	always	sneak	off	campus	at	lunch.	Sometimes	you	go	to	the
park.	Sometimes	her	apartment.	She	talks	about	guys	between	drags	of	Marb
Reds	(the	only	brand	to	smoke,	in	her	opinion).	Sheâ€™s	always	dating	some	older
guyâ€¦sometimes	a	lot	older.	You	think	itâ€™s	pretty	creepy,	but	you	donâ€™t	tell	her
so.	Sheâ€™s	not	the	first	girl	youâ€™ve	known	whoâ€™s	dated	older	guys.	And	you	donâ€™t
want	her	to	know	how	inexperienced	you	are.	You	donâ€™t	want	her	to	know	a	lot
of	things.
You	wonder	why	she	hangs	out	with	you,	why	she	doesnâ€™t	see	you	for	the	dork
you	think	you	are.	A	big	night	for	you	is	hanging	out	at	the	park	with	your	best
friend	and	his	skater	buddies,	trying	to	get	brain	freeze	from	Slurpees.	But	your
first	night	with	her	is	something	youâ€™ll	never	forget.	Nothing	major	happens,
but	itâ€™s	your	first	taste	of	her	worldâ€”a	world	that	will	soon	become	yours.
She	sends	some	guys	to	your	house	to	pick	you	up	while	she	gets	ready.	She
only	just	met	these	guys	the	day	before.	They	show	up	in	this	old	muscle	car.
You	wonâ€™t	remember	the	make	or	modelâ€¦just	that	it	was	green	and	loud.	Sheâ€™s
dating	the	driver,	who	looks	and	dresses	a	lot	like	Spike	in	Buffy	The	Vampire
Slayer	(youâ€™ll	see	what	I	mean	in	a	couple	years).	He	likes	his	car	and	his	metal]]></text>

You	donâ€™t	talk	to	them.	They	donâ€™t	talk	to	you.	The	guy	in	the	flannel	keeps
looking	at	you,	though.	Like	he	wants	to	say	something.	Heâ€™s	quieter	than	the

BACK.	RIGHT.	NOW.
Miranda	Kenneally
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™ve	fallen	for	a	guy	youâ€™ve	known	for	pretty	much	your	whole	life.
Letâ€™s	call	him	Charlie.	He	hugs	you.	He	writes	notes	on	the	backs	of	your
hands,	using	those	orange	and	purple	gel	pens	you	love	so	much.	He	swaps
sneakers	with	you.	You	laugh	like	crazy	together,	reciting	lines	from	the	Austin
Powers	movies.	He	always	grabs	a	seat	next	to	you	in	the	church	van.
Then	he	decides	he	likes	your	friend,	and	they	start	dating.	You	want	to	die.
He	knows	you	love	him,	but	heâ€™s	just	not	into	you	like	that.	And	heâ€™s	the	whole
reason	you	decided	to	become	a	manager	for	the	boysâ€™	soccer	team!	So	now
youâ€™re	stuck	with	him	every	day	at	practice	and	at	games.	You	canâ€™t	stop
looking	at	him,	thinking	about	him.
You	believe	that	if	he	doesnâ€™t	start	liking	you	back	soon,	you	will	die.	For	real.
Now	for	a	bit	of	good	news:	There	are	some	seriously	hot	senior	guys	on	the
soccer	teamâ€”but	every	time	they	look	your	way,	you	bow	your	head	and	avoid
them.	You	talk	to	the	guys	who	are	your	age	instead.	You	know	you	arenâ€™t
pretty.	Youâ€™re	nice	and	sweet	and	funny	but	guys	donâ€™t	like	you.	They	like	your
friends.	They	ask	you	to	put	in	a	good	word	for	them	with	Julie	and	Stephanie.
One	day	on	the	sidelines,	the	captain	of	the	teamâ€”letâ€™s	call	him	Jackâ€”sits
down	beside	you	on	the	grass.	Heâ€™s	eighteen	and	has	this	cropped	brown	hair
and	a	nice	smile.	Heâ€™s	very	cute	in	that	all-American	guy	kind	of	way.	Even	in
February,	he	has	a	tan.	Heâ€™s	about	to	graduate.
Youâ€™re	fifteen.	Thereâ€™s	no	way	in	hell	a	guy	like	this	is	into	you,	so	you	just	act
like	yourself.	You	make	him	laugh.	You	tell	him	about	this	really	cheesy
pickup	line	you	heard.	â€œI	may	not	be	Fred	Flintstone	but	I	sure	can	make	your
bed	rock.â€
He	laughs.]]></text>

â€œYeah,	I	know.â€
â€œWhy	donâ€™t	you?â€	you	ask,	just	curious	to	know.
He	adjusts	his	shin	guard.	Reties	the	laces	on	his	cleats.	â€œI	dunno.	I	just
havenâ€™t.â€
â€œYou	should	come	sometime.	Itâ€™s	fun.	This	summer	weâ€™re	going	on	a	choir	tour
to	Florida	and	weâ€™re	doing	this	mission	trip	thing,	too.â€
Jack	smiles	at	you.
The	next	Sunday,	he	comes	to	church.	He	hangs	around	with	the	preacherâ€™s	son
â€”the	guy	who	plays	quarterback	for	the	football	teamâ€”and	some	of	the
cheerleaders.	And	thatâ€™s	fine.	Heâ€™s	very	popular	and	in	a	different	circle	than
you.	But	it	makes	you	happy	that	he	came.
Over	the	next	several	weeks,	he	keeps	coming	to	church	and	you	start	telling
him	more	about	your	life.	You	tell	him	about	how	much	you	like	Charlie.	Jack
is	sympathetic	and	listens	to	you	whine	about	this	other	guy	who	is	so	not	worth
your	time.
Right	before	he	graduates,	Jack	writes	a	note	in	your	yearbook.	He	tells	you
how	much	heâ€™s	enjoyed	getting	to	know	you.	That	he	thinks	youâ€™re	awesome.
You	show	it	off	to	your	friends.	â€œCan	you	believe	he	wrote	thatâ€¦to	me?!	Isnâ€™t
he	so	hot?â€
Your	friends	are	most	jealous,	indeed.	You	read	his	inscription	over	and	over.
Over	the	summer,	he	goes	on	the	church	mission	trip	with	you.	Youâ€™re	playing
a	game	of	poker	after	a	day	of	painting	an	underprivileged	familyâ€™s	home.
Youâ€™re	practically	in	tears	because	Charlie	has	started	hooking	up	with	yet
another	girl,	one	he	just	met	on	this	very	mission	trip.	Jack	tells	you	he	doesnâ€™t
know	why	you	care	about	Charlie.
â€œYou	can	do	better,â€	Jack	says.	â€œYouâ€™re	nice.	Youâ€™re	honest	and	open.â€
You	hear	what	he	says,	but	you	donâ€™t	really	listen	to	him.	Miranda,	you	should
be	listening	to	this	guyâ€”this	smart,	nice,	and	thoughtful	guy	who	keeps	coming
to	your	church	events	now	that	youâ€™ve	asked	him	to.
A	few	days	after	you	get	home	from	the	mission	trip,	youâ€™re	lying	on	your	bed,

Charlie	anymore,	because	theyâ€™re	sick	to	death	of	your	obsession	with	him.	You
feel	alone.

â€œHey,â€	he	says.	â€œWant	to	come	over	to	my	house	and	swim?	My	parents	arenâ€™t

All	you	can	think	about	is	Charlie.	What	if	he	calls	while	youâ€™re	at	Jackâ€™s
house?	Cell	phones	arenâ€™t	really	mainstream	yet.	You	donâ€™t	have	a	pager.

terrible	kisser	because	youâ€™ve	never	had	any	practice?	Thereâ€™s	no	way	in	hell	a
guy	like	him	would	kiss	me	anyway,	you	think.
You	remember	all	the	guys	youâ€™ve	liked	over	the	years.	None	of	them	have
liked	you	back.	A	few	boys	have	liked	you,	but	you	werenâ€™t	interested	in	them.
(You	never	gave	them	a	chance.	You	were	too	worried	that	people	would	make
fun	of	you	for	hanging	around	â€œdorkyâ€	guys.)
You	donâ€™t	bother	to	think	about	Jackâ€™s	feelings	because	you	assume	that	he,
like	everyone	else	(yourself	excluded),	lives	a	golden	life.	What	if	Jack	needs	a
friend?	What	if	heâ€™s	lonely	and	looking	for	something	and	wants	to	tell	you
about	it?	Did	you	ever	think	that	he	started	coming	to	church	because	you	asked
him	to?	Because	he	thought	you	cared	enough	about	him	to	include	him?
Why	donâ€™t	you	ever	think	about	anyone	but	yourself,	Miranda?	What	if	Jack
needs	you?
â€œI	canâ€™t	come	over.â€
â€œOkay.	Well,	Iâ€™ll	talk	to	you	later,â€	Jack	replies,	and	hangs	up.

Stephanie	Kuehnert
Dear	Teen	Me,
It	started	when	he	made	you	give	Acacia	that	poor,	pink,	stuffed	duck	that	heâ€™d
burned	and	stabbed	and	defaced	with	permanent	marker	with	words	like
Skunkhead,	which	was	supposed	to	insult	Acacia	because	sheâ€™d	bleached	half	of
her	black	hair	blond.	â€œSheâ€™s	copying	you,â€	he	said,	referring	to	the	blond	streak
youâ€™d	had	in	your	hair	for	three	months.	You	said	you	didnâ€™t	see	it	that	way,	but
he	insisted,	â€œSheâ€™s	jealous	of	youâ€”of	us	being	together.	Sheâ€™s	been	spreading
rumors	about	us.â€
You	doubted	this	and	you	were	right	to.	He	cut	you	off	from	Acacia	first	for	the
simple	reason	that	she	was	the	biggest	threat.	If	the	two	of	you	had	stayed	close,
she	wouldâ€™ve	noticed	what	he	was	doing	to	you.	He	said	that	she	was	out	to	get
you.	You	believed	him,	because	he	was	the	first	boy	to	tell	you	that	he	loved
you.
He	even	said	it	before	you	did.	Youâ€™d	only	been	together	for	two	weeks.	It	was
earth-shattering.	This	gorgeous	guyâ€”a	talented	musician	who	looked	like	a
dark-haired,	hazel-eyed	Kurt	Cobain	and	smelled	like	sandalwood	incense,
cigarettes,	and	warm	sheetsâ€”loved	you,	a	girl	who	had	just	been	used	by	two
other	gorgeous	guys.
Of	course	if	he	really	had	been	like	Kurt	Cobain,	he	wouldâ€™ve	joined	you	in
trying	to	kick	the	convertible	filled	with	loud,	obnoxious	jocks.	They	were

shoulder	and	lifted	your	skirt,	flashing	your	underwear	to	the	busy	street.	When

your	skirt	was	too	short	and	those	fishnet	tights	made	you	look	like	a	slut.	After
a	few	more	arguments	like	this,	including	one	where	he	shredded	your	favorite
shirt,	you	adopted	a	baggy,	multilayered	uniform.
You	were	all	he	had	(he	said),	so	when	you	did	something	to	upset	him,	he	told

     <text><![CDATA[HOPE	UNTIL	THE	LAST	SECOND
Mary	Lindsey
Dear	Teen	Me,
The	adults	around	you	love	to	say,	â€œLifeâ€™s	not	fairâ€â€”which	is	totally
unnecessary.	Youâ€™re	slapped	in	the	face	with	that	fact	every	time	you	step
through	the	door	to	your	house.	Just	like	you,	the	house	seems	cheerful	and
composed	from	the	outside,	but	inside,	itâ€™s	a	disaster.
You	use	the	trick	you	learned	in	acting	class:	Work	from	the	inside	out,	and	if
that	doesnâ€™t	achieve	the	desired	effect,	cloak	from	the	outside	in.
I	remember	that	last	day	of	summer	before	your	freshman	year	of	high	school.
You	made	a	pact	with	yourself.	You	closed	the	door	to	the	laundry	room	(it	was
the	only	way	to	get	away	from	them),	and	you	vowed	to	never	give	in	to
addiction.	You	would	not	give	up	on	yourself	or	on	your	future.	You	would
never	be	like	them,	and	you	would	never	allow	anyone	to	make	you	feel	bad
about	yourself.	Most	of	all,	youâ€™d	never	let	anyone	in	on	your	private	life
outside	of	school.	Success	is	based	on	appearances,	and	you	would	appear	to	be
normal.
On	one	hand,	this	was	a	fantastic	strategy.	At	sixteen,	youâ€™d	realized	that	self-
worth	and	outer	impressions	are	keys	to	success.	You	have	loads	of	friends
(however	superficial	they	may	be)	and	will	even	be	elected	cheerleaderâ€”the
pinnacle	of	high	school	success,	right?
On	the	other	hand,	your	strategy	is	unhealthy.	Youâ€™re	lucky	this	plan	worked,
because	holding	things	in	is	not	only	stressful,	but	it	can	be	physically	and
psychologically	dangerous.
Next	year,	when	youâ€™re	seventeen,	youâ€™ll	find	someone	with	whom	you	can
share	your	pain	and	struggle.	Someone	who	will	understand	what	youâ€™re	going
through	and	who	wonâ€™t	judge	you,	gossip	about	you,	or	lord	your	secrets	over
you.	Someone	who	will	tell	you	that	you	can	rise	above	it.	Someone	who
believes	in	you	unconditionally,	and	who	will	hold	a	place	in	your	heart	for	the
rest	of	your	life.]]></text>

TO	CUTE	BOYS
Nikki	Loftin
Dear	Teen	Me,
I	wish	I	could	stop	you.
I	wish	I	could	stop	you	from	even	sitting	on	that	tree	swing	with	your	First	Real
High	School	Boyfriend	(heâ€™s	a	sophomore	and	youâ€™re	just	a	freshman!),	Bill
Underhill.*	Because	I	see	where	this	is	going.	And	I	really	wish	I	could	stop
you	from	leaning	in	for	that	first	kiss.	(That	atrocious,	saliva-soaked,	tongue-so-
far-down-your-throat-you-gag-and-almost-throw-up-Lucky-Charms,	 poorly
executed	car	wash	of	a	French	kiss.)
But	mostly?	I	wish	I	could	stop	you	from	saying	what	you	say	about	three
kisses	later.
When	you	askâ€”oh	Godâ€”if	he	wouldnâ€™t	mind	NEVER	kissing	you	like	that
again?	Because	heâ€™s	a	great	boyfriend,	but	UGH!	THAT	WAS	SO	GROSS!
You	know	whatâ€™s	next:	No	more	boyfriend.
Youâ€™ve	pretty	much	always	come	right	out	and	said	what	you	thought,	without
thinking	about	the	consequences.	There	are	lots	of	times	when	it	doesnâ€™t	turn
out	all	that	great	(although	having	your	face	exfoliated	by	Billâ€™s	tongue	one
more	time	would	have	been	cause	for	homicide,	so	maybe	you	were	right	to
insult	the	guy),	but	that	runaway	mouth	of	yours	is	going	to	cause	real	pain	to
friends	and	family	members.	Enough	pain	that	I	really,	really	wish	I	could	get
you	to	listen	to	this	one	piece	of	advice:	Whether	you	intend	to	compliment	or
insult,	think,	for	just	a	second,	before	you	speak.
Itâ€™s	probably	hopeless.	Still,	donâ€™t	despair.	Your	tendency	to	blabâ€™s	going	to	do
some	good,	too.
For	instance,	in	a	month,	your	friends	will	start	telling	you	how	much	the
cute/popular	Ray	Vargas	likes	you.	At	the	first	high	school	dance,	when	he	asks
you	to	dance,	youâ€™ll	say	yes,	thrilled	not	to	be	the	Utter	Social	Reject	you	were]]></text>

â€œSo,	youâ€™re	cute,â€	heâ€™ll	say.
Youâ€™ll	giggle.
But	then	heâ€™ll	say,	â€œI	hear	you	dated	some	real	loser	last	year.	Why	would	you
do	that?â€
You	have	a	sudden	vision	of	the	â€œloserâ€	he	means:	that	darling	seventh-grade
boy	who	brought	you	roses	and	made	you	a	set	of	twelve-inch-tall	initialsâ€”
N.L.â€”out	of	scrap	metal	in	shop	class	(which	he	subsequently	painted	gold).
And	what	this	Ray	character	just	said	about	him	will	completely	tick	you	off.
Your	mouth	will	start	to	move	before	you	can	think.	Before	you	wonder	if	you
shouldnâ€™t	just	smile	and	say,	â€œI	donâ€™t	know.	Silly	me,â€	or	something	equally
dumb.	Instead,	youâ€™ll	take	a	step	back	and	say,	â€œWell,	I	guess	I	didnâ€™t	think	he
was	such	a	loser,	or	I	wouldnâ€™t	have	dated	him.â€
And	then	youâ€™ll	leave	that	popular	jerk	standing	alone	on	the	dance	floor.
It	doesnâ€™t	matter	that	youâ€™ll	hide	in	the	bathroom	the	rest	of	the	night,
wondering	if	youâ€™d	just	committed	social	suicide	(you	hadnâ€™t).
Trust	me	when	I	tell	you:	This	moment	is	one	instance	where	that	mouth	of
yours	got	it	exactly	right.
Even	though	it	might	have	been	easier,	socially,	to	keep	your	mouth	shut,	you
stood	by	a	person	that	you	really	valued.	You	spoke	the	truth.
So	try	to	be	a	little	kinder	when	youâ€™re	criticizing	your	sisterâ€™s	clothing,	hair,
and	hygieneâ€”but	when	it	comes	to	standing	up	for	the	so-called	losers	of	the
world?	Let	your	mouth	do	its	thing.
Justâ€”keep	it	away	from	Bill	Underhillâ€™s	tongue?	A	valiant	mouth	like	yours
doesnâ€™t	need	that	kind	of	trauma.
P.S.	Not	getting	along	with	Bill	and	Ray	frees	you	up	later	to	date	an	amazing
boyâ€¦who	kisses	very	well!

     <text><![CDATA[THE	BEST	DAYS	OF	OUR	LIVES?	REALLY?
Katherine	Longshore
Dear	Teen	Me,
You	know	that	theyâ€™re	lying	to	you.
You	sit	in	a	crowded	auditorium,	breathing	the	reek	of	stale	French	fries	and
dirty	shoes.	Assaulted	by	the	clang	and	angst	of	a	hundred	other	voices.	And
pitying	the	anonymous,	faceless	administrator	calling	for	attention,	announcing
the	title	of	the	film	youâ€™re	about	to	see:	The	Best	Days	of	Your	Life.
Images	of	football	games	and	track	meets,	homecoming	queens	and	student
government	meetings	crowd	the	screen,	showering	everyone	with	relentless
cheer.
You	stare	into	the	screen	onstage,	with	images	of	prom	and	chemistry	flickering
across	it.	And	you	imagine	whatâ€™s	behind	that	screen:	The	worn	boards,	the
black	wing	curtains,	the	jumble	of	leftover	props	from	dozens	of	plays.
And	thatâ€™s	what	you	want.	Not	the	jerseys	and	pom-poms,	but	the	props	and
rigging.
In	your	first	role	on	that	high	school	stage	youâ€™ll	play	a	catatonic	mental
patient.	Youâ€™ll	sit	in	a	heap	for	two	hours.	Not	moving.	Not	speaking.	Your
only	â€œlineâ€	will	be	a	glass-shattering	scream.
But	then	youâ€™ll	go	on	to	play	an	exiled	Russian	duchess,	a	head	in	a	box	(which
eventually	gets	its	cheerleader	body	back),	a	variety	show	MC,	and	a	dead
woman	(the	play	is	in	flashback,	and	your	part	is	actually	the	lead).
Youâ€™ll	nurture	a	deep	love	for	theaterâ€”and	itâ€™s	not	just	because	it	gives	you	the
chance	to	be	the	object	of	appreciation	and	applause.	Youâ€™ll	fall	in	love	with	the
character	of	Ariel	at	the	Oregon	Shakespeare	Festival	(and	eventually	youâ€™ll
even	have	the	chance	to	play	the	part	in	a	circus	tent	in	England).	Sam	Shepard
will	become	your	literary	crush,	and	youâ€™ll	never	lose	your	desire	to	ride	a
streetcar	as	Blanche	DuBois.
On	that	stage,	youâ€™ll	discover	your	place	in	this	madhouse.	Within	this	building
â€”this	architectural	monstrosity	that	looks	more	like	a	prison	than	a	place	of]]></text>

the	day	you	get	battered	on	a	deserted	African	road,	or	the	day	when	you	learn
about	your	dadâ€™s	cancer.
The	truth	is	that	your	memories	of	these	days	will	inspire	you.	They	will

facing	failure.	Theyâ€™ll	give	you	a	taste	for	the	unusual,	and	for	diving	into
things	just	because	theyâ€™re	new.

Ken	Lowery
Dear	Teen	Me,
Itâ€™s	meâ€”that	is,	itâ€™s	you,	about	thirteen	years	into	the	future.	You	have	a	great
job	that	you	love,	youâ€™re	happily	married,	and	Bean	is	still	the	same	cat	that	she
was	thirteen	years	ago.	A	black	guy	is	president,	and	you	voted	for	him.
Craziest	of	all,	youâ€™re	internet	famousâ€”at	least	among	a	certain	subset	of
professional	word-fanciers	and	grammar	pedants.
Now	that	Iâ€™ve	blown	your	mind,	letâ€™s	get	down	to	brass	tacks:	Youâ€™re	on	your
way	to	a	major,	depression-fueled	meltdown.	Some	of	that	will	be	driven	by
simple,	treatable	biology;	the	rest,	Iâ€™m	sorry	to	say,	has	to	do	with	some
unhealthy	notions	youâ€™ve	got	about	what	it	means	to	be	an	adult.
The	good	news	is	that	with	a	whole	lot	of	therapy	and	some	supernaturally
wonderful	friends	and	family,	you	will	make	it	through	to	the	other	side.	The
bad	news	is	that	your	unhealthy	notions	about	adulthood	still	cast	a	shadow
over	everything	you	say	and	do.
Hereâ€™s	the	source	of	your	problems,	in	a	nutshell:	You	believe	that	if	you	make
it	through	high	school,	get	into	a	good	college	(doesnâ€™t	matter	which	one),	and
get	your	degree	(likewise	doesnâ€™t	matter),	you	will	then	â€œgrow	upâ€â€”which	to
you	means	simply	going	through	a	kind	of	ceremony	(after	whichâ€”presto,
youâ€™re	mature),	instead	of	actually	evolving.	Then,	once	youâ€™re	among	the
ranks	of	the	Mature	Adults,	you	imagine	that	youâ€™ll	know,	more	or	less,	exactly
what	to	do	for	the	rest	of	your	time	on	earth.
This	notion	of	life	lived	on	autopilot	seems	like	bliss	to	you,	because	it	means
an	end	to	the	struggle,	an	end	to	doubt.	You	will	no	longer	cut	classes	or	skip
out	on	work	for	no	reason.	You	will	no	longer	stay	up	till	4:00	am	and	sleep	in
until	3:00	pm	because	you	canâ€™t	think	of	anything	else	to	do.	You	will	no	longer
respond	to	that	beast	of	a	question,	â€œHow	are	you	feeling?â€	with	your	usual	â€œI
donâ€™t	know,â€	because	your	complete	inability	to	articulate	what	goes	on	in	your
head	will	no	longer	matter.
This	is	a	childlike	vision	of	happiness,	but	itâ€™s	also	a	vision	of	oblivion.	In	this]]></text>

Two	things:	One,	outside	of	an	airplane,	there	is	no	such	thing	as	autopilot.	All
the	other	adults	are	making	this	shit	up	as	they	go	along.	Theyâ€™re	winging	it.
The	advice	youâ€™ve	received	from	your	elders	and	betters	has	helped	you
through	a	lot,	but	guess	what:	They	were	winging	it,	too.	Adults	and	parents	do
not	appear,	fully	formed,	from	Central	Casting.
Two:	The	â€œwinging	itâ€	stuff	is	okay.	Itâ€™s	preferable,	in	fact,	to	the	rosy-tinted
nihilism	you	fantasize	about	now.	Because	being	an	adult	means	knowing	that
youâ€™re	winging	it,	and	being	okay	with	that.	Eventually,	youâ€™ll	realize	this.
Eventually,	youâ€™ll	see	that	â€œgrowing	upâ€	is	an	ongoing	process,	not	a	finish	line.
And	youâ€™ll	look	back	on	what	youâ€™ve	accomplished,	what	youâ€™ve	done,	and
what	youâ€™ve	simply	survived,	and	youâ€™ll	trust	yourself	to	move	forward.
Life	is	full	of	uncertainty,	yes,	but	art	is	born	out	of	the	same	stuff.	What	you
can	and	will	be	certain	about,	however,	is	that	you	can	handle	the	uncertainty.
That	is	a	real	strength

Kekla	Magoon
Dear	Teen	Me,
Put	down	that	book	and	pay	attention	for	a	minute.
Someday	soon,	youâ€™ll	live	an	amazing	and	very	different	kind	of	life	than	the
one	youâ€™re	living	nowâ€”but	youâ€™ll	have	to	put	the	books	down	and	get	out	into
the	world	before	that	can	happen.	I	know	how	lonely	you	are.	I	know	that	what
you	want	most	is	to	have	a	best	friend,	someone	that	you	can	trust	with	your
secrets	and	be	real	with,	and	who	will	hug	you	and	tease	you	and	accept	you	for
who	you	really	are.	(Whatever	that	means.)
When	you	try	to	blend	in	it	doesnâ€™t	really	work,	does	it?	Youâ€™re	the	only
biracial	girl	in	your	class.	That	â€˜fro	canâ€™t	hide	from	nothinâ€™.	You	donâ€™t	feel
black,	so	you	donâ€™t	fit	in	with	the	â€œrealâ€	black	kids,	but	you	donâ€™t	look	white,	so
you	stand	out	among	the	white	kids,	too.	But,	when	it	comes	down	to	it,	you
really	donâ€™t	need	to	try	so	hard	to	fit	in.	People	actually	like	you.	Itâ€™s	okay	to	be
yourself	and	let	down	your	guard.
Itâ€™s	not	just	being	biracial	that	makes	you	feel	different.	Remember	the	time	in
gym	class	when	that	girl	said	you	were	probably	a	lesbian?	Of	course	you
remember.	You	thought	about	nothing	else	for	weeks	after,	and	it	scared	and
confused	you.	Let	it	go.	It	scared	you	because	it	might	have	been	a	little	bit
true;	it	confused	you	because	it	wasnâ€™t	totally	true.	Youâ€™re	going	to	love	some
guys	in	your	life	and	youâ€™re	going	to	love	some	girls,	too,	and	thatâ€™s	fine.	Most
people	arenâ€™t	going	to	understand	this	about	you,	but	youâ€™ll	have	to	get	used	to
that	feeling,	because	itâ€™s	never	going	to	go	away.
Everything	about	you	is	a	little	bit	different.	The	way	you	look,	the	way	you
act,	the	way	you	are.	You	just	have	to	remember	to	look	at	yourself	in	the
mirror	every	morning	and	see	yourself	as	beautiful.	If	you	can	manage	to	do
that,	the	rest	will	take	care	of	itself.	It	might	be	hard	to	believe	that	you	will
ever	find	your	place	in	the	world,	but	you	willâ€”once	you	start	being	truly
yourself.	Sometimes	by	just	relaxing	a	little	you	can	accomplish	a	lot.

Mari	Mancusi
Dear	Teen	Me,
Iâ€™ve	got	an	update	for	you	from	the	future:	Alex	A.	wrestles	alligators	for	a
living,	and	he	loses	every	time.
Okay,	okay,	my	update	isnâ€™t	completely	nonfictional;	I	donâ€™t	know	that	for
sure.	He	might	have	ended	up	as	a	partner	at	a	highly	successful	law	firm.	Or
invented	the	inexplicably	popular	PajamaJeans	(as	seen	on	TV).	For	all	I	know
he	couldâ€™ve	retired	at	twenty-nine	after	making	a	killing	on	his	Apple	stock.	I
donâ€™t	know	what	heâ€™s	actually	doing	these	days,	but	I	have	to	admit:	I	like	to
imagine	his	clothes	reeking	of	swamp	and	defeat	at	the	end	of	the	workday.
I	know,	I	know.	Itâ€™s	not	very	nice	to	wish	such	misfortune	on	a	former
classmate.	Especially	one	who	might	be	off	digging	wells	right	now,	so	that
thirsty	children	somewhere	can	have	clean	water	to	drink.
But	I	canâ€™t	help	it.	I	look	back	at	the	way	he	treated	you	in	junior	high	and	it
still	makes	me	furious.
Back	then,	not	too	many	people	talked	about	bullying.	And	even	fewer	did
anything	about	it.	If	anything,	parents	had	this	crazy	idea	that	whatever	didnâ€™t
kill	you	would	make	you	stronger.

Gretchen	McNeil
Dear	Teen	Me,
You	always	needed	the	spotlight.
Not	wanted.	Not	coveted.	Needed.
Positive	or	negative,	you	needed	the	attention.	You	were	the	loudest	kid	at	the
partyâ€”the	one	most	likely	to	accept	a	dare,	or	do	something	ridiculous	to	get	a
laugh.	Itâ€™s	possible	you	hold	the	world	record	for	the	number	of	times	you	had
to	write	â€œI	will	raise	my	hand	before	speakingâ€	in	the	course	of	sixth	grade.
And	the	same	thing	goes	for	the	number	of	trips	to	the	principalâ€™s	office
(because	you	could	never	resist	making	that	last	witty	comeback).	Did	you	even
consider	how	your	mother	would	feel	after	the	umpteenth	time	she	was	called
in	to	discuss	your	behavior?
Your	mom	blames	herself,	but	you	both	know	itâ€™s	not	her	fault.	Your	need	for
attention	is	so	deeply	rooted	in	your	personality,	so	tangled	up	in	your
complicated	emotional	relationship	with	your	absentee	father,	that	thereâ€™s	no
getting	beyond	it.	At	this	point,	youâ€™ve	spent	so	many	years	jumping	through
hoops	to	get	him	to	notice	you,	that	the	behavior	has	become	ingrained.
You	got	straight	Aâ€™s	in	school.	Did	that	make	him	call?	You	were	the	star	of	the
soccer	team.	Did	that	help	him	remember	your	birthday?	You	sang	at
graduation.	Did	that	force	him	to	show	up?	No,	no,	no.
Iâ€™ve	got	some	bad	news	for	you:	Heâ€™s	never	going	to	notice,	acknowledge,
remember,	or	even	just	show	up.	Never.	But	that	doesnâ€™t	stop	you	from	trying.
But	hereâ€™s	the	good	news:	Extroverted	attention-seekers	have	a	perfect	outlet	on
the	stage.
Sure,	youâ€™ve	been	performing	since	you	were	a	kid,	but	not	in	such	a	serious
role,	and	never	in	a	musicalâ€”with	a	curtain	call	all	your	own.	Backstage,
youâ€™re	lined	up,	ready	to	take	your	solo	bow	in	the	spotlight.	As	you	run	out
onstage,	youâ€™re	terrified,	convinced	that	youâ€™re	about	to	run	into	a	mass	of
stares,	and	a	few	polite	claps.	But	then	it	happensâ€”and	youâ€™ll	remember	that]]></text>

HAPPINESS
Jodi	Meadows
Dear	Teen	Me,
I	know	how	it	is.	Your	parents	are	divorced,	have	been	since	you	were	four,	and
traveling	between	them	is	how	you	grew	up.	But	now	youâ€™re	a	teenager	with
school,	work,	and	practice,	and	you	donâ€™t	have	time	to	go	back	and	forth.	The
days	you	used	to	visit	Dad	are	now	days	you	spend	on	your	own,	just	doing
your	thing.	Besides,	Dadâ€™s	changed	a	lot	in	the	last	few	years.	Visiting	him	isnâ€™t
the	same	anymore.
Your	dad	is	sick.	You	know	it.	You	know	about	the	alcoholism,	the	smoking,
the	diabetes,	and	the	way	he	can	get	hurt	by	simply	walking	to	the	kitchen.	You
know	he	hasnâ€™t	been	Dad	since	he	lost	his	job;	he	canâ€™t	hold	a	new	one,	and	his
house	is	filthy.	You	know	you	donâ€™t	enjoy	visiting	him	anymore.
Hereâ€™s	what	youâ€™re	not	recognizing:	Heâ€™s	given	up.
His	kids	arenâ€™t	kids	anymore.	The	adult	kids	have	kids	of	their	own.	You	and
your	sister	visit	Dad	sometimes.	You	clean	the	house.	You	hassle	him	about
drinking	too	much	and	remind	him	that	smoking	will	give	him	lung	cancer	one
day.	You	complain	with	your	sister	that	it	doesnâ€™t	seem	like	heâ€™s	even	trying
anymore.
Heâ€™s	not.	Heâ€™s	killing	himself,	and	he	doesnâ€™t	even	care.
In	a	few	years,	youâ€™ll	get	married	and	move	away.	Youâ€™ll	try	to	talk	to	Dad	on
the	phone,	but	youâ€™ll	be	lucky	if	he	answers.	And	toward	the	endâ€”though	you
wonâ€™t	realize	itâ€™s	the	endâ€”you	wonâ€™t	be	able	to	get	hold	of	him	at	all.	Itâ€™s

should	answer	the	phone	for	his	daughters	if	he	wants	to	be	involved	in	their
lives.
You	wonâ€™t	hear	from	him	until	heâ€™s	found	himself	in	the	hospital,	with	cancer
(yes,	lung	cancer)	and	a	host	of	other	problems.	You	wonâ€™t	even	have	time	to

     <text><![CDATA[THIS	IS	NOT	YOUR	STORY
Saundra	Mitchell
Dear	Teen	Me,
All	right,	look.	You	didnâ€™t	kill	him.
Youâ€™re	going	to	spend	tonight	in	the	laundry	room,	sitting	on	the	dryer.
Shuttered	doors	closed,	and	phone	pulled	as	far	as	the	cord	will	go,	so	you	can
complain	about	it	to	your	best	friend.
Your	idiot	brother,	who	swallows	all	the	energy	in	the	family,	who	screws	up
everything,	is	at	the	hospital.	Again.	Last	time,	he	was	drunk	and	passed	out
and	nearly	burned	his	foot	off	at	his	makeshift	camp	in	the	woods.
And	today,	you	came	home	from	school	and	he	was	drunk.	Again.	You	could
tell	because	of	all	the	empty	beer	cans	in	the	living	room.	He	was	passed	out,
again.	You	could	tell	by	the	way	he	was	sprawled	across	the	living	room	carpet.
With	his	stupid	mouth	agape.	With	his	stupid	hand	on	his	stupid	chest.
Was	he	going	to	wake	up?	You	dug	your	toes	into	his	ribs,	way	harder	than	you
had	to,	and	pushed.	Pushed	hard.	Later,	youâ€™ll	think	you	kicked	him,	like
straight-up	soccer-goal	kicked	him,	but	you	didnâ€™t.	Guilt	magnifies	things,	but
the	truth	is,	you	shoved	him,	and	he	didnâ€™t	wake	up.
So	you	called	mom	and	bitched,	â€œHeâ€™s	drunk.	Again.â€
You	called	your	best	friend	and	bitched,	â€œHeâ€™s	drunk.	Again.â€
But	thereâ€™s	a	family	history	with	alcohol.	Youâ€™ve	got	a	bunch	of	extended
relatives	who	all	have	an	extended	relationship	to	the	hooch	(itâ€™s	funny	how
weâ€™re	all	kind	of	proud	of	the	grandmother	who	bootlegged	during	Prohibition).
You	know	that	passed	out	drunks	usually	wake	up.	Or	move.	Or	something.
So	when	you	got	nervous,	and	checked	to	see	if	he	was	breathing,	he	was.	His
heart	was	beating.	And	he	did	smell	like	beer.	You	did	call	your	mother.	Thatâ€™s
it.	Those	are	the	facts	in	evidence.	As	soon	as	you	realized	that	all	the	pill
bottles	in	the	kitchen	window	were	empty,	you	did	the	right	thing.
You	called	Mom.	You	called	Dad.	You	helped	them	carry	your	brother	to	the]]></text>

hospital.	You	knew	better	than	to	call	911,	because	ambulances	are	expensive,
and	nobody	in	the	family	can	afford	them.
And	now	youâ€™re	holed	up	in	the	laundry	room,	air	thick	and	warm	and	spring
fresh,	and	youâ€™re	going	to	rail	about	it	for	a	while.	How	he	always	does	this.
How	he	runs	away	on	the	holidays	and	screws	up	birthdays,	and	how	heâ€™s	so
busy	destroying	everything	around	him	that	you	may	as	well	not	even	exist.
After	a	while,	youâ€™ll	get	scared.	Youâ€™ll	bluster	about	how	youâ€™re	going	to	kill
him	when	he	gets	home	from	the	hospital.	Eventually,	youâ€™ll	just	hope.	When
the	other	line	rings,	you	wonâ€™t	say	anything	when	your	mother	tells	you	that
your	brother	is	dead.
You	wonâ€™t	hear	anything,	either.	Later,	the	details	will	get	filled	in,	passively,
randomly.	Pumped	his	stomach,	but	it	was	already	too	late.	Took	all	of	his
antidepressants,	blood	alcohol	level	was	negligible.
Youâ€™ll	go	through	his	room	and	discover	somebody	else	was	in	the	house	that
day,	because	all	of	his	Metallica	tapes	are	missing.	There	will	be	a	funeral
where	you	walk	out	on	God,	and	so	many	people	in	the	house,	and	for	some
reason,	Mom	will	bring	that	yellow	and	green	blanket	home.
When	you	get	evicted	from	public	housingâ€”bloodlessly	informed	that	you	no
longer	meet	minimum	occupation	requirements	for	a	three-bedroom	apartment
â€”the	blanket	will	go	with	you.	In	the	new	apartment,	itâ€™ll	be	there,	on	the
couch.	On	the	chair.	Youâ€™ll	put	it	away	and	wish	you	could	burn	it.	Itâ€™s	a
shroud,	exactly	the	shape	of	death;	youâ€™ll	hate	it	because	sometimes	youâ€™ll	need
a	break	from	hating	yourself.
But	that	afghan	didnâ€™t	kill	him,	and	neither	did	you.	It	doesnâ€™t	matter	that	you
tried	to	OD	two	years	ago,	taking	pills	off	that	same	windowsill.	He	wasnâ€™t
thinking	about	you	that	day.	It	wasnâ€™t	your	idea.	You	didnâ€™t	pull	the	trigger;
there	wasnâ€™t	even	a	trigger	to	be	pulled.	Your	brother	was	mentally	ill	and
couldnâ€™t	get	the	treatment	he	needed.	He	self-medicated	until	he	couldnâ€™t	self-
medicate	any	more.	It	had	nothing	to	do	with	you.
Nevertheless,	itâ€™s	going	to	be	a	while	(a	couple	of	decades	at	least)	before	you
realize	all	that.	Before	you	realize	that	weâ€™re	all	dead	for	longer	than	weâ€™re	ever
alive.	Before	you	realize	that	shoving	him	with	your	foot	isnâ€™t	the	same	as
kicking	him	with	jackboots.	Before	you	understand	that	you	were	there	that
day,	you	were	one	of	the	players,	but	the	story	wasnâ€™t	about	you	at	all.]]></text>

Hannah	Moskowitz
Dear	Teen	Me,
So	you	have	this	CD	you	burned	a	few	weeks	ago,	and	youâ€™ve	listened	to	it	God
knows	how	many	times	now,	because	ever	since	you	got	your	license	youâ€™ve
hardly	left	your	car.	Itâ€™s	just	easier	to	drive	around	and	go	out	for	coffee	(which
you	donâ€™t	like)	with	boys	(who	you	donâ€™t	like)	than	it	is	to	go	home	and	stare	at
all	the	food	you	want	to	eat	and	cry	over	the	94	percent	on	your	test	(because
what	about	the	other	six	points).	Because	then	you	eventually	just	have	to	go	to
bed	for	your	four	hours	of	sleep	before	you	have	to	repeat	the	whole	thing
againâ€¦and	againâ€¦and	again.
Lately	you	have	an	extra	hour	in	the	car	every	week,	because	youâ€™re	driving	to
and	from	therapy	trying	to	shake	that	eating	disorder.
Youâ€™re	about	to	turn	seventeen,	and	it	doesnâ€™t	matter	how	much	you	want	to	get
out	of	the	house	and	listen	to	those	same	songs	again	and	again	and	again;
driving	scares	the	crap	out	of	you	(it	still	does),	so	half	the	time	you	call	and
cancel	the	therapy	appointments	five	minutes	before	theyâ€™re	due	to	start,	which
means	your	parents	still	get	charged	the	full	amount,	which	means	your	parents
probably	think	youâ€™re	going,	but	instead	you	lie	on	the	floor	and	count	your
ribs,	and	youâ€™ve	never	hated	yourself	as	much	as	you	do	when	you	see	what
you	are	doing	to	your	mother	all	the	hell	over	her	face.	You	take	pictures	of
yourself	sucking	in	your	stomach	and	leave	them	on	her	camera	because	you
just	donâ€™t	care	anymore,	because	this	stopped	being	fun	a	long	time	ago,	and
your	favorite	clothes	are	too	big,	and	now	the	only	good	part	of	any	of	this	is
that	CD.
Iâ€™m	listening	to	the	songs	I	can	remember	from	it	while	I	write	this,	and	Iâ€™m
right	back	there	in	the	parking	lot	where	you	used	to	park	illegally,	sitting	in	the
car	instead	of	going	in	to	therapy,	seat	pushed	all	the	way	back,	crying	so	hard
you	canâ€™t	breathe.	Iâ€™m	there	too.	Pretend	Iâ€™m	there	the	whole	time,	okay?
Because	I	havenâ€™t	forgotten.	I	remember	you,	Hannah.
And	I	know	what	you	want	to	hear	more	than	anything	else	in	the	world,	what]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[youâ€™re	dying	to	hear,	what	you	want	so	much	to	be	trueâ€”and	listen	to	me,
because	it	is	true.	Ready?
This	isnâ€™t	normal.
Itâ€™s	not.	Itâ€™s	not	normal	and	you	donâ€™t	have	to	go	through	it.	Youâ€™re	not	weak.
Youâ€™re	a	chick	with	some	messed	up	brain	chemistry,	and	youâ€™re	crying	in	the
parking	lot	afraid	to	take	meds	because	you	think	you	wonâ€™t	be	able	to	write
anymore	if	things	donâ€™t	hurt	this	much.
About	six	months	ago	you	wrote	that	book	about	the	kid	who	wants	to	break	all
his	bones	(and	in	about	a	year	and	a	half	people	are	going	to	start	asking	you,
â€œHow	do	you	know	so	much	about	self-injury?â€	and	youâ€™re	going	to	smile	and
talk	around	the	question).	A	few	days	from	now,	youâ€™re	going	to	be	standing	on
the	sidewalk	outside	your	therapistâ€™s	office	when	your	agent	calls	and	tells	you
that	youâ€™re	going	on	submission,	but	sheâ€™s	going	to	tell	the	publishers	youâ€™re
seventeen,	okay,	because	no	one	wants	to	work	with	a	sixteen-year-old,	and
God,	can	you	understand,	because	you	have	to	live	with	a	sixteen-year-old	and
you	have	to	watch	your	parents	try	to	live	with	a	sixteen-year-old	and	youâ€™d	get
out	of	all	of	that	somehow	if	you	knew	how.	(You	donâ€™t	get	out.	You	stay.	And
thank	you	for	that,	Hannah.	Thank	you	for	that	every	single	day.)
Your	therapist	asks	questions	you	donâ€™t	know	how	to	answer.	You	think	maybe
turning	seventeen	will	help,	and	then	you	turn	seventeen	and	it	gets	worse	and
junior	year	slips	through	your	fingers.	You	sleep	through	prom	and	your	best
friendâ€™s	graduation.	You	get	your	lowest	GPA	ever.	Itâ€™s	unacceptable,	because
if	you	donâ€™t	get	into	Brown,	you	donâ€™t	know	what	youâ€™ll	do.
(You	get	into	Brown.	After	the	first	month,	youâ€™re	ready	to	get	the	hell	out	of
there.	You	transfer	home	to	the	huge	state	school	you	refused	to	ever	apply	to.
Itâ€™s	incredible.)
Look.
Itâ€™s	not	normal.
Youâ€™re	not	normal.
And	I	know	that	if	I	were	there	really	sitting	in	the	car	next	to	you,	and	you
heard	these	wordsâ€”words	that	everyone	else	in	the	world	would	probably	think
are	horribleâ€”you	would	latch	onto	them.	Because	yes,	I	understand.	You	are
not	overreacting	and	you	are	not	imagining	that	things	really	are	unfathomably
difficult,	and	you	are	so	not	alone.]]></text>

angry	all	the	time.	Itâ€™s	not	hormones	and	itâ€™s	not	a	phase,	and	I	believe	you,	and
you	should	have	actually	talked	to	that	therapist	and	reached	out	and	gotten	the
help	you	needed	a	long	time	ago,	because	youâ€™re	going	to	keep	doing	this	for
years,	and	it	just	does	not	have	to	be	this	hard.
â€œSuffering	for	your	artâ€	is	just	a	pretty	phrase	people	say,	okay?
But	youâ€™re	not	going	to	listen,	and	youâ€™re	going	to	keep	doing	this	to	yourself
for	a	long	time.
Youâ€™ll	probably	be	surprised	at	what	fixes	itself	when	you	get	better.	Things
that	seem	irreparably	broken	now,	like	your	relationship	with	your	mom?	You
two	are	going	to	have	an	amazing	relationship.	Your	best	friend	whoâ€™s	doing
even	worse	than	you	are?	Sheâ€™s	okay	now,	too.
Those	songs	you	listened	to	while	you	drove	to	therapy	and	out	for	coffee	with
boys	or	around	your	neighborhood	and	thought	about	food	the	entire	way	every
time?	Those	songs	are	eating	disorder	songs	and	will	be	until	the	day	you	die.
You	broke	those	songs.
But	itâ€™s	okay.	Because	here	I	am,	as	better	as	it	really	gets,	listening	to	those
songs	and	remembering	you.
Whatâ€™s	funny	is	that	I	canâ€™t	write	a	good	story	thatâ€™s	in	any	way	related	to	your
eating	disorder.	Iâ€™ve	tried,	believe	me,	because	everyoneâ€™s	always	telling	me	to
write	what	I	know,	but	the	truth	is,	your	ED	ruined	that	story	for	me,	because
now	itâ€™s	full	of	details	that	arenâ€™t	important	and	donâ€™t	make	any	larger	sense,
and	theyâ€™re	clogging	up	the	big	picture	and	Iâ€™m	so	filled	with	shame	when	I	try
to	type	that	I	canâ€™t	ever	make	it	sound	real.	You	took	that	story	off	the	table.	Itâ€™s
the	same	reason	that	when	you	wanted	to	write	a	book	with	self-injury,	you	had
to	have	the	kid	break	his	bones,	because	you	took	all	the	normal	stuff	off	the
table,	didnâ€™t	you?	You	stole	the	stories.	You	keep	stealing	stories.
Stop.	Leave	me	something	to	work	with.	Donâ€™t	make	me	try	to	make	art	out	of
your	suffering.	It	doesnâ€™t	work.
Get	better.
Get	better.
Get	better.
And	get	a	fucking	move	on,	because	I	have	all	these	books	to	write	and	you
need	to	not	use	up	any	more	stories	because	Iâ€™m	bad	enough	at	coming	up	with]]></text>

Jenny	Moss
Dear	Teen	Me,
Itâ€™s	your	senior	year.
Youâ€™re	in	English	class,	at	a	desk	in	the	back	corner	of	the	room,	with	a	point	to
make	about	Hester	Prynne	in	The	Scarlet	Letter,	but	your	teacher	turns	away,
her	wiry	black	and	silver	hair	shaking,	as	she	laughs	with	the	cheerleaders	and
student	council	members,	and	you	wantâ€¦What?â€¦What	is	it	you	want?
I	see	your	confusion.	Youâ€™re	so	distracted	by	those	around	you	that	you	donâ€™t
know	what	you	want.
So	listen	to	me	for	a	moment.
Think	of	your	wildest	dreams.
Talking	with	Hemingway	and	Fitzgerald	about	art,	life,	and	things	that	matter
until	late	into	the	night	at	a	smoky	Parisian	bistroâ€¦
Catching	a	glimpse	of	a	nervous	Shakespeare	gathering	his	actors	before	they
take	the	stage	in	the	court	of	Elizabeth	Iâ€¦
Laughing	at	Dorothy	Parkerâ€™s	quips	at	the	Algonquinâ€¦
Those	might	not	be	possible.	Try	again.
Studying	literature	at	a	centuries-old	universityâ€¦
Writing	in	longhand	at	a	French	cafÃ©â€¦
Watching	the	Tuscan	countryside	roll	by,	with	your	backpack	at	your	side	and
your	journal	in	your	lapâ€¦
Grab	hold	of	those	dreams.
Put	aside	your	need	to	do	the	practical	thing.	Research	far-flung	colleges.	Find
a	guidance	counselor.	Dream	more,	dream	bigger,	dream	wilder.
Ask:	â€œWhat	do	I	want?	What	do	I	want?	What	do	I	want?â€]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Read.	(Waitâ€”you	already	do	that.)	Read	more.	Keep	reading.
Seek	advice.	Think.	Listen.
Understand	that	what	works	for	someone	else	might	not	work	for	you.
(Example:	those	red	Coca-Cola	pants	and	top	your	mother	thought	would	look
great	on	you.)	Understand	that	not	everyone	sees	the	world	as	you	do.
(Example:	Not	everyone	hears	beauty	and	mystery	and	magic	when	Bob	Dylan
sings.)	Understand	that	there	are	other	paths.	(Example:	Studying	physics	at	a
college	an	hour	from	your	house	is	just	one	choice.)	Be	patient,	but	act.
Sometimes	the	worst	decision	is	no	decision.
Make	mistakes.	Change	your	mind.	Itâ€™ll	be	okay.
Remember:	Your	greatest	strength	is	your	greatest	weakness	is	your	greatest
strength.	Things	will	make	more	sense	if	you	can	come	to	terms	with	that.
Your	dreams?	Remember	those?	Are	you	still	holding	on?
Soâ€¦ignore	that	English	teacher	who	loves	only	the	popular	kids.	You	have	a
future	she	wonâ€™t	be	a	part	of.	Ignore	those	girls	who	are	laughing	at	you	now.
You	have	more	important	things	to	think	about.	Instead,	listen	to	the	voice
inside	of	you,	the	one	saying,	I	want	to	be	part	of	the	conversation.
Keep	writing	in	private.	Youâ€™re	getting	better.
Keep	doing	math.	You	love	it.
Keep	singing	in	the	church	choir.	You	may	be	tone-deaf,	but	God	hears	you
perfectly.
Consider	the	following:	You	can	be	in	a	Montparnasse	cafÃ©	or	at	the	Algonquin
Hotel	on	a	1920s	evening,	and	you	can	talk	to	anyone	you	want	about	anything
you	wantâ€¦.
If	thatâ€™s	what	you	really	want,	find	a	way.

Sarah	Ockler
Dear	Teen	Me,
Prom	is	the	most	important	night	of	your	life.
Thatâ€™s	what	everyone	keeps	telling	you,	anyway.	A	night	to	remember,	they
say.	Something	youâ€™ll	reflect	on	with	fondness	and	joy	and	maybe	a	bit	of
longing,	too,	when	you	can	no	longer	stuff	that	thirty-something	ass	into	your
teen-something	poofy-sleeved	dream	dress.
Hey,	you	only	live	once,	right?
Screw	that.
Thing	is,	you	donâ€™t	have	a	boyfriend.	And	yeah,	you	could	invite	one	of	your
guy	friends	from	another	school,	or	go	stag.	Butâ€¦stag.	Do	you	really	want	to
spend	another	weekend	bobbing	around	the	dance	floor	in	an	awkward,
gyrating	clump	with	your	few	remaining	girlfriends,	arms	entwined,	belting	out
those	heartbreaking	Bon	Jovi	ballads?	Youâ€™re	practically	a	college	woman,	for
the	love	of	hair	spray.	Who	needs	prom?
Umâ€¦pretty	much	everyone	you	know,	apparently.
And	though	you	donâ€™t	solicit	their	to-go-or-not-to-go	advice,	your	classmates
are	happy	to	dish	it	out.	Youâ€™ll	regret	it,	they	warn!	Youâ€™ll	miss	out	on	the	most
magical,	momentous	night	of	your	life!
Honestly,	you	feel	kinda	sad	that	some	people	believe	the	most	magical,
momentous	night	of	their	entire	lives	could	possibly	be	over	and	done	with
before	their	eighteenth	birthday.	I	mean,	you	havenâ€™t	even	experienced	a	proper
orgasm	yet,	let	alone	Indian	food	or	marrying	your	best	friend	or	a	road	trip	to
the	Grand	Canyon	or	climbing	the	highest	mountain	in	Colorado	or	writing	a
book	(all	coming	in	due	time).	But	this	wonâ€™t	stop	the	rite	of	passage	do-
gooders	from	trying	to	convince	you	otherwise,	what	with	their	vivid	depictions
of	your	promless	future	and	all.	Stopping	them	would	take	an	act	of	God.	Or
maybeâ€¦

     <text><![CDATA[The	Dead	are	coming	to	town	on	prom	weekend,	you	gleefully	discover!	Soon
the	entire	county	will	be	overrun	by	patchouli-scented,	pot-smokinâ€™,	peace-
lovinâ€™	Deadheads,	and	if	magical	moments	are	what	youâ€™re	after,	you	canâ€™t
think	of	a	better	crowd	to	inspire	a	few.
The	decision	is	easy	now.	Youâ€™re	ditching	prom	to	hang	out	with	the	Dead.	And
your	best	friend,	Melissa,	is	coming	with	you.	Neither	of	you	has	enough	cash
to	buy	tickets,	but	thatâ€™s	okay.	Youâ€™ll	show	up	anyway,	hang	out	on	the
grounds,	and	catch	a	few	riffs	from	the	open-air	arena.
When	the	big	night	arrives,	you	pack	Melissaâ€™s	old	Civic	with	blankets	and
snacks	and	all	your	raging,	naked	excitement	and	head	to	the	stadium,	high	on
rebellion	and	big-eyed	dreams.	The	grounds	are	alive	with	cars	and	buses,	tents,
girls	in	long	skirts,	and	boys	kicking	hacky	sacks	and	blowing	bubbles	into	the
sky.	Campfires	and	hot	dogs	and	earthy	sage	spice	the	air,	and	you	close	your
eyes	and	take	it	all	in,	memorizing	every	detail.
Melissa	pulls	the	gold	Civic	into	a	disorganized	tangle	of	cars	that	stretches	into
the	next	county.	Thereâ€™s	a	faded	red	and	white	NO	PARKING	sign,	but	you
come	to	the	only	logical	conclusion:	Itâ€™s	a	concert.	They	canâ€™t	possibly	tow
everyone.
You	leave	the	car	beneath	the	sign	and	meld	into	the	crush	of	barefooted,	hairy-
legged	Deadheads	meandering	toward	the	stadium.	People	sell	beer	out	of	giant
ice	chests;	others	sell	weed	out	of	Whitmanâ€™s	Sampler	boxes.	You	pass	by	these
industrious,	homegrown	vendors	until	a	better	offer	catches	your	attention.
â€œFree	hugs,â€	a	twenty-something	guy	calls	out.	Heâ€™s	cute;	seems	like	a	fair	deal.
You	take	him	up	on	the	offer.	Heâ€™s	a	good	hugger,	too,	and	you	get	your
moneyâ€™s	worth.	Perfect,	since	youâ€™ve	only	got	fifteen	bucks	to	your	name.
You	find	a	good	spot	on	the	grass	outside	the	stadium	and	stretch	out	on	a
blanket	the	color	of	the	sky.	You	and	Melissa	watch	the	sunset,	sipping	two
sugary	wine	coolers	that	her	brother	snagged	for	you.	Music	floats	on	the	air,
drifting	on	pale	purple	smoke	into	the	night.	All	around	you,	baby	Deadheads
toddle	naked	through	the	grass	while	women	braid	their	hair	and	men	sway	in
trippy,	rhythmic	circles.	You	fantasize	about	them.	About	dropping	out	and
falling	in	with	a	new	family,	traveling	the	country,	following	the	music.	Youâ€™re
a	writer,	after	all,	and	thereâ€™s	a	story	in	that	kind	of	life.	Youâ€™re	a	hippie,	too,
deep	down	where	it	counts.	You	want	to	grow	vegetables	and	braid	your	hair
and	walk	around	smelling	like	the	earth.	You	want	to	learn	the	words	to	all	the
songs,	to	understand	the	stuff	that	Jerry	Garcia	sings	about.]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[To	unravel	the	mystery	of	why	good	music	always	makes	you	cry.
But	thatâ€™s	for	the	future,	maybe.	Tonight,	youâ€™re	just	happy	to	be	there.
Sometime	after	the	first	set,	the	stadium	doors	open,	and	security	calls	you
forth,	ushering	in	the	poor,	ticketless	masses	for	a	chance	to	see	the	stage.	The
Dead,	it	turns	out,	welcome	all.	Youâ€™re	entranced.	When	you	reach	the	top	of
the	stairs	and	step	out	into	the	stands,	your	heart	flutters.	Jerryâ€™s	leading	the
band	in	this	crazy	jam,	part	jazz	riff,	part	folksy	drum	trip.	There	are	no	words,
just	rich	music,	and	everyone	in	the	packed	stadium	sways	and	spins,	hands
floating	up	like	little	birds.	Colored	lights	illuminate	the	stage,	and	though
youâ€™re	way	up	high,	the	energy	reaches	you	and	fills	you	with	an	inexplicable
human	connectedness	the	likes	of	which	youâ€™ll	never	again	feel.	Soon,	your
hands	float	up	like	the	rest,	and	you	dance.
At	the	end	of	the	show,	you	drift	on	the	current	of	the	crowd,	flowing	outside
like	water.	You	donâ€™t	speak,	but	you	look	at	your	best	friend	and	smile,	eyes
shining.	Itâ€™s	that	kind	of	night,	and	you	drop	your	last	fifteen	bucks	on	a	T-shirt
to	commemorate	it.	â€œToke	up,	Doc,â€	it	says	under	a	red-eyed	Bugs	Bunny
doing	just	that.
(FYI,	the	shirt	isnâ€™t	exactly	a	crowd-pleaser	with	school	officials	that	Monday,
or	with	your	parents,	but	thatâ€™s	a	story	for	another	letter.)
You	and	Melissa	are	so	enraptured	that	you	donâ€™t	immediately	notice	the	cop
looking	out	across	the	field,	standing	in	the	empty	spot	where	Melissaâ€™s	car
ought	to	be.	The	illegally	parked	vehicles	have	been	impounded,	he	announces.
You	can	reclaim	them	at	the	station	for	a	fee	of	one	hundred	and	eighty-five
dollars.
You	look	at	the	shirt	in	your	hands.
Thatâ€™s	all,	folks.
Youâ€™re	stranded.
You	could	take	your	chances	at	Camp	Deadhead,	you	think.	Put	that	fantasy	in
motion,	find	a	nice	dreadlocked	family	and	share	their	wool	blankets	until	itâ€™s
time	to	shove	off	at	dawnâ€¦.
No.	Look	around.	Take	a	deep	breath	of	tea-scented	air	and	assess	the	situation.
Thereâ€™s	trash	everywhere,	cans	and	bottles	overflowing	from	barrels,	dotting
the	grass	like	aluminum	flowers.

grocery	store,	youâ€™re	bleary-eyed	and	delirious,	but	you	earn	nearly	two
hundred	bucksâ€”four	thousand	cansâ€™	and	bottlesâ€™	worth.
Enough	to	free	the	car	and	snag	a	box	of	doughnuts	for	the	ride	home,	way	too
many	hours	past	curfew.
That	show	was	one	for	the	archives.
You	witnessed	history	that	night.	Two	years	later,	Jerry	Garcia	will	be	dead.
The	prom	show	will	end	up	being	the	bandâ€™s	last	appearance	in	town.
And	you	were	there.
In	some	ways,	your	classmates	are	right.	You	will	look	back	on	prom	night	with
fondness	and	joy.	And	for	the	rest	of	your	life,	people	will	swear	that	prom	was
the	most	magical,	momentous	night	of	their	lives,	and	theyâ€™ll	wonder,	as	they
did	then,	whether	you	regret	ditching	the	dance.	But	I	promise	you	something:
Youâ€™ll	never	regret	it.	Not	once.
Because	you	got	to	dance	with	the	Dead.
And	twenty	years	later,	in	the	quiet	that	follows	your	most	magical,	momentous
nights,	sometimes	youâ€™ll	catch	yourself	singing	an	old	song	with	your	eyes
closed,	and	youâ€™ll	remember	those	crazy	riffs	and	the	sky-blue	blanket	full	of
bottles	and	youâ€™ll	smile,	your	heart	full	and	content.

     <text><![CDATA[BEST	FRIENDS	FOREVER	(FOR	REAL)
Lauren	Oliver	and	Elizabeth	Miles
Dear	Teen	Elizabeth	(from	Lauren	Oliver),
First	off,	let	me	say:	You	really	got	me	through	high	school.	Without	your
support	and	friendship,	Iâ€™m	not	sure	I	would	have	made	it	out.	So,	thank	you.
Iâ€™m	very	happy	to	tell	you	that	you	will	grow	into	a	beautiful,	accomplished,
and	beloved	young	woman,	and	Iâ€™m	even	happier	to	tell	you	that	you	and	I	will
remain	best	friends.
There	are	a	few	other	pieces	of	information	Iâ€™d	like	to	send	along	your	way,	so
bear	with	me.
1.	First	off,	your	hair	looks	super	cute	when	itâ€™s	really	short.	Go	ahead	and
lop	it	off!	Youâ€™ll	look	like	a	beneficent	pixie.
2.	Secondly,	DONâ€™T	SMOKE.	Seriously.	Put	down	the	cigarettes	NOW.	If
you	donâ€™t,	you	and	I	will	struggle	with	quitting	throughout	our	twenties.	It
totally	isnâ€™t	worth	it.
3.	Remember	all	those	boys	who	broke	our	hearts	over	the	years?	There
was	Brett	(you),	Dan	Waitman	(me),	Steve	(me	again),	Brett	again	(you);
there	were	Jons	and	Adams	and	Matts	and	countless	others.	Sometimes	we
suffered	for	days	or	weeks.	Sometimes	we	cried,	sometimes	we	starved,	and
sometimes	we	couldnâ€™t	stop	eatingâ€”but	we	always	leaned	on	each	other
(and	on	an	occasional	dose	of	Pride	and	Prejudice	and	a	certain	Mr.	Colin
Firth)	to	get	us	through.
I	wonâ€™t	say	now	that	those	experiences	werenâ€™t	worth	it,	but	you	should
know	that	they	were	just	like	the	math	problems	we	had	to	do	in	calcâ€”
their	greatest	worth	was	that	they	taught	us	process.	In	the	case	of	calc,	we
learned	how	to	think;	in	the	case	of	the	Toms,	Jons,	and	Adams,	we
learned	how	to	how	to	feel	and	to	love.	It	wasnâ€™t	about	the	particulars,	but
the	generals:	All	that	heartbreak	helped	us	learn	how	to	heal,	and	it	helped
us	become	better	and	better	at	relationships.
4.	Your	parents	are	great	in	some	ways	and	crazy	in	others.	So	are	mine.
They	wonâ€™t	necessarily	understand	us	any	better	as	we	get	older.	But	we]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[can	understand	them	better,	and	understand	that	they	have	their	own	issues
and	limitations	that	are	absolutely	not	reflections	of	us.	Your	parents	love
you	and	theyâ€™re	doing	the	best	they	can.
5.	Donâ€™t	be	afraid	to	ask	for	help	when	you	need	it.	Youâ€™re	going	to	go
through	some	dark	times.	Iâ€™ll	be	there	for	you.	So	will	Laura	and	Jackie.	So
will	Dafna,	who	will	become	your	best	friend	in	college,	and	so	will	various
other	people	who	love	you.	Lean	on	us.
6.	Go	to	therapy!
7.	Youâ€™re	going	to	be	tempted	to	move	to	DC	and	go	to	grad	school	some
day.	Skip	that	whole	section	of	your	life;	go	straight	to	Portland,	Maine.
Youâ€™ll	love	it	there.
8.	You	may	not	know	this,	but	I	was	really	jealous	of	you	in	high	school.
Boys	always	seemed	to	fall	in	love	with	you,	and	rightly	so.	And	I	felt	they
always	just	used	me	because	of	my	somewhatâ€¦questionable	morals	and
attitudes.	Anyway,	I	just	want	to	say:	That	was	my	problem,	not	yours,	and
Iâ€™m	sorry.	You	deserve	to	be	loved.	So	do	I,	for	that	matter!
9.	Donâ€™t	let	me	get	so	drunk	at	your	house	in	Otis	after	prom!!	Ugh.	I
thought	I	was	going	to	die.
10.	Youâ€™ll	be	okay.	Youâ€™ll	be	more	than	okay.	Youâ€™ll	be	great.
Love,
Dear	Teen	Lauren	(from	Elizabeth	Miles),
I	canâ€™t	believe	we	ever	hated	each	other.	Remember	that?	How	you	thought	I
was	always	either	laughing	hysterically	or	sobbing	(true),	and	how	I	thought
you	were	a	snob	(also	true)?	Thank	God	for	Alanis	Morissette	and	eggs	with
ketchup	and	Pride	and	Prejudice	and	the	Beatles	and	the	rest	of	the	random	and
wonderful	things	we	eventually	bonded	over.	If	not	for	them,	I	may	have
missed	out	on	a	truly	rewarding	friendship	with	an	impressive,	generous,
beautiful	woman.	Iâ€™ve	read	your	letter,	and	in	responseâ€”and	in	order	to	thank
you	for	being	my	best	friend,	then	and	nowâ€”Iâ€™ve	compiled	some	of	my	own
advice	tidbits:
1.	My	hair	looks	good	short?	Yours	looks	goodâ€”striking,	reallyâ€”when	itâ€™s]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[combed.
2.	DONâ€™T	SMOKE!	Itâ€™s	the	worst.	Itâ€™s	an	expensive	habit	that	will	give	us
wrinkles!	Who	wants	wrinkles?!
3.	You	are	one	sexy	chica	and	you	can	work	it.	You	know	it,	I	know	it,
boys	know	it,	and	girls	know	it.	Itâ€™s	a	complicated	thing,	being	a	woman
who	is	both	seductive	and	smartâ€”and	that	balancing	act	doesnâ€™t	get	any
easier	as	you	get	older.	Rest	assured,	your	charms	go	far	beyond	your	pretty
face,	hot	body,	and	racy	sense	of	adventure.	Donâ€™t	exploit	yourself.	Trust	in
the	fact	that	youâ€™re	loved	now,	and	that	youâ€™ll	continue	to	be	loved	in	the
future,	for	much	more	than	your	sex	appeal.
4.	We	had	a	list	in	the	back	of	our	shared	journal:	â€œHook-Up	Deal-Breakers
and	Makers.â€	That	list	may	not	be	as	relevant	these	days	(not	least	because
of	that	ring	on	your	finger),	but	its	underlying	philosophy	is	right	on:	We
deserve	the	best.	Itâ€™s	okay	to	say	what	we	want	and	to	identify	what	we
donâ€™t.
5.	Youâ€™re	going	to	experience	some	terrible	lossesâ€”too	much,	too	early.
Do	what	you	can	in	these	teenage	years	to	make	yourself	resilient,	to
understand	that	bad	things	happen	to	good	people,	to	cultivate	sources	of
support	both	internal	and	external	that	you	can	rely	on	when	your	worst-
case	scenarios	become	reality.
6.	Totally,	go	to	therapy.
7.	Even	though	we	were	best	friends,	we	never	really	talked	about
â€œpopularityâ€	per	se.	Thatâ€™s	probably	a	good	thingâ€”we	were	too	busy	trying
to	remember	our	harmonies	for	Quaker	Notes.	But	despite	having	a	sizeable
group	of	friends	and	being	involved	in	several	inclusive	school	activities,	I
know	I	was	still	worried	that	so-and-so	doesnâ€™t	like	me,	and	secretly
thrilled	to	have	been	invited	to	that	party,	etc.	First	of	all,	teenage	Lauren,
letâ€™s	be	open	with	each	other	about	these	concerns.	And	second	of	all,	if
you	have	them	too,	just	know	that	weâ€™ll	realize	SOON	after	high	school
which	friendships	matter	and	which	ones	donâ€™tâ€”in	fact,	the	closeness	that
you,	I,	Laura,	and	Jackie	share	is	an	anomaly,	not	the	norm.	Now,	eleven
years	after	high	school,	I	talk	to	precisely	four	people	who	I	knew	back
then.
8.	Just	like	I	should	skip	my	hemp-necklace-wearing	phase,	you	should
pass	over	the	faux-bling-wearing	phase	(wait	until	you	can	afford	the	real
stuff)â€”hippie	chic	and	gaudy	baubles	donâ€™t	really	suit	us.
9.	Maybe	pressure	me	to	hand	in	at	least	one	of	my	AP	European	History
assignments	on	time?	How	do	you	do	it?	(â€œIt,â€	in	this	case,	means	having	a
relatively	normal	teenage	life	and	getting	straight	Aâ€™sâ€”God,	I	was	so]]></text>

Stephanie	Pellegrin
Dear	Teen	Me,
Psst!	Hey!	You	in	the	corner	of	the	library	with	your	nose	stuck	in	a	book.	Yes,
you.	Donâ€™t	recognize	me	without	that	awful	perm,	do	you?	(Remind	me	again
why	you	thought	that	was	a	good	idea?)
Anyway,	I	hope	you	donâ€™t	mind	if	I	sit	with	you	for	a	minute,	but	we	need	to
talk.	Donâ€™t	worry	about	the	â€œno	talking	in	the	libraryâ€	rule.	Iâ€™m	sure	weâ€™ll	be
fine.	Librarians	arenâ€™t	as	bad	as	they	seem.
Judging	from	the	hair	and	braces	Iâ€™d	have	to	guess	youâ€™re	in	your	junior	year.
Yes?	Thought	so.	Iâ€™d	forgotten	how	many	lonely	lunch	hours	you	spent	in	the
school	library.	You	have	some	friends	in	the	cafeteria	that	you	could	sit	with,
but	you	donâ€™t	feel	like	you	really	fit	in,	do	you?	Thatâ€™s	why	you	joined	every
school	club	you	could.	I	just	counted	and	youâ€™re	in	eighteen,	not	to	mention	the
numerous	after-school	activities	youâ€™re	involved	in.	I	mean	honestly,	you	joined
the	ROTC.	You	donâ€™t	even	like	ROTC!	And	I	wonâ€™t	even	bother	bringing	up
that	time	you	tried	ballet.	Iâ€™m	still	having	nightmares	about	the	fifth	position!
Let	me	ask	you,	howâ€™s	it	all	working	out?	Not	very	well,	am	I	right?	By
spending	so	much	time	trying	to	find	yourself,	youâ€™re	slowly	losing	yourself.
We	donâ€™t	all	have	one	single	rock-star	talent,	and	honestly,	I	think	those	of	us
who	donâ€™t	are	the	lucky	ones.	Life	isnâ€™t	about	finding	the	one	thing	youâ€™re	good
at	and	never	doing	anything	else;	itâ€™s	about	exploring	yourself	and	finding	out
who	you	really	are	on	your	own	terms	and	in	your	own	way.	You	donâ€™t	have	to
exhaust	yourself	to	do	that.
Oh,	donâ€™t	be	so	down	in	the	dumps	about	it.	Youâ€™ll	eventually	find	something
youâ€™re	good	at,	I	promise.	Itâ€™s	a	long,	winding	road	to	get	there,	but	youâ€™ll	find
it.	Being	able	to	spend	all	day	doing	what	you	love	(or	one	of	the	things	that
you	love)	is	the	most	amazing	feeling	in	the	world.	And	no,	I	wonâ€™t	tell	you
what	it	is,	so	donâ€™t	even	ask	me.	Just	remember	to	always	be	yourself,	because
thereâ€™s	nobody	else	who	can	do	it	for	you.	I	think	E.	E.	Cummings	put	it	best
when	he	said,	â€œIt	takes	courage	to	grow	up	and	become	who	you	really	are.â€]]></text>

Mitali	Perkins
Dear	Teen	Me,
I	know	youâ€™ve	liked	himâ€”adored	him,	reallyâ€”for	full-on	two	years	now.	But
somehow,	nobody	knows	about	it,	not	even	friends	who	share	their	crushes	in
intimate	detail.	You	pour	the	truth	only	into	journals	stashed	deep	in	desk
drawers.
Heâ€™s	a	basketball	star	with	strawberry-blonde	hair	and	blue	eyes.	You?	The
only	dark-skinned	girl	in	schoolâ€”a	straight-A	nerd,	trying	to	obey	traditional
Hindu	parents	and	squandering	babysitting	money	on	trendy	jeans.
But	you	both	play	tennis.	And	he	needs	help	in	English	class.	So	youâ€™re	friends.
Now	itâ€™s	junior	year.	Youâ€™re	losing	hope.	You	think	thereâ€™s	no	way	heâ€™s	going
to	like	you.	Not	in	that	way,	not	a	chance.	When	youâ€™re	standing	in	a	group	of
white	girls,	the	guys	look	right	past	you.
But	wait.	Be	patient.	Let	me	show	you	somethingâ€¦.
â€œWant	to	go	to	the	amusement	park	with	a	bunch	of	us	this	Saturday?â€	he	asks,
passing	your	table	on	the	way	to	eat	lunch	with	his	basketball	buddies.
Youâ€™re	with	your	regulars,	but	heâ€™s	looking	at	you.	Right	at	you.	Only	at	you.
â€œSure,â€	you	say,	managing	to	keep	your	voice	as	easy	and	relaxed	as	his.
The	regulars	are	quiet,	but	only	for	a	bit.	You	see	them	shrug	and	shake	it	off.	A
blip,	for	sure.	Guys	ask	them	out	in	front	of	you,	not	vice	versa,	right?	Youâ€™re
the	confidante	they	trust	around	that	boyfriend	with	a	wandering	eye:	Youâ€™re
not	quite	invisible	but	you	are	safely	neutered.	Loveless	but	beloved.
Saturday	dawns,	a	breezy,	summery	Santa	Cruzâ€“perfect	day.	You	chat	with	the
others	on	the	drive,	but	once	you	get	into	the	park	and	ride	the	carousel	twice,
everybody	else	disappears.
I	promise	this	will	happen.	Donâ€™t	give	up.

buddy	banter	continues	and	you	avoid	his	eyes.
On	the	ride	home,	tired	and	squashed	in	the	back	with	the	others,	you	wonâ€™t
talk.	But	he	rests	an	arm	along	the	back	of	the	seat,	his	T-shirt	soft	against	your
neck.	Your	ponytail	brushes	his	skin.	Will	he	feel	how	fast	your	heart	is
beating?	You	pretend	to	watch	the	scenery.	He	closes	his	eyes	after	the	sunset.
One	by	one,	the	others	get	dropped	off.	Now	itâ€™s	just	the	two	of	you	in	the
backseat,	but	he	wonâ€™t	slide	to	the	other	window.	No,	he	stays	close,	denim	leg

yourself	not	lean	into	him	in	the	darkness.
As	the	car	stops	in	front	of	your	house,	his	eyes	flick	to	the	rearview	mirror.
You	open	the	door	and	swing	a	leg	out.	â€œThanks	so	much,â€	you	say.
In	one	quick	move,	as	smooth	and	agile	as	when	he	scores	a	layup	at	the	buzzer,
he	leans	over	and	kisses	your	cheek.	â€œYouâ€™re	beautiful,â€	he	whispers.
The	car	pulls	away.
You	wonâ€™t	remember	how	long	you	stand	outside	the	house.
Youâ€™ll	forget	if	the	night	was	starry	or	if	the	plums	on	the	tree	were	ripe.
But	youâ€™ll	never	forget	that	kiss,	soft	on	your	cheek.	Those	words,	spoken	low
in	your	ear.	And	the	dizzy,	overwhelming	sweetness	of	being	seen,	known,	and
wantedâ€”all	for	the	first	time.

Cheryl	Rainfield
Dear	Teen	Me,
I	know	you	dream	of	escape,	of	being	rescued,	of	never	being	hurt	again.	I
know	you	think	your	pain	will	never	end,	and	sometimes	you	donâ€™t	know	how
to	go	on.	And	I	know	you	think	about	killing	yourself.	Youâ€™re	good	with
blades,	and	you	know	that	you	could	do	it.	But	something	stops	you.	And	that
something	is	good:	Itâ€™s	hope.	Hope,	tenacity,	and	your	fighting	spirit.
I	know	that	when	your	pain	feels	unbearable,	when	every	second	seems	like
torture,	you	cut	yourself	in	secret,	then	carefully	hide	the	evidence	beneath	long
sleeves.	But	you	wish	someone	would	see	the	truth	and	ask	â€œwhy?â€	You	wish
someone	could	see	past	your	parentsâ€™	facades,	their	â€œprotectiveness,â€	and	their
tight	smiles,	and	see	how	cruel	they	really	are.
I	know	it	seems	like	it	will	never	endâ€”the	rape,	the	tortureâ€”and	so	you	push	it
down	as	hard	as	you	can	and	try	to	forget,	but	fragments	keep	slicing	into	your
mind.	Somehow,	youâ€™re	sure	that	remembering	is	the	only	way	to	get	safe.	And
youâ€™re	right.	Remembering	and	telling	your	story	is	the	key	to	your	safety.
You	will	escape.	Youâ€™ll	run	away	from	home,	and	when	they	find	you	again,
youâ€™ll	have	to	endure	even	more	abuse.	But	youâ€™ll	keep	building	up	your	inner
strength	so	that	you	can	find	a	way	to	break	away	again	and	again	and	again.
Each	and	every	time	that	you	cut	off	contact	with	your	abusers,	you	liberate

PARTY	LIKE	ITâ€™S	1999
Jess	Rothenberg
Dear	Teen	Me,	Greetings	from	the	future!	So	I	know	youâ€™re	super	busy	with
studying,	college	apps,	tennis	practice,	memorizing	your	lines	for	Peter	Pan,
backing	your	new	car	into	a	tree,	trying	(and	failing)	to	tame	that	totally	frizz-
tastic	hair	of	yours,	and	watching	Titanic	for	the	eightieth	timeâ€”but	I	have	to
ask	you	for	a	small	favor.	(Hint:	The	favor	involves	backing	away	from	the	â€œI	?
Leonardo	DiCaprioâ€	chat	room	for	just	a	quick	second.)	So	being	that	I	am	you
â€”except	ten	or	twelve	years	from	nowâ€”I	wanted	to	pop	in	with	a	few	pointers
on	how	to	make	the	next	phase	of	life	a	little	less	painful	and	a	little	more	fun.
Iâ€™m	not	going	to	give	you	ALL	the	answers,	since	(a)	that	would	be	cheating
and	(b)	Iâ€™m	still	searching	for	most	of	them	myself,	but	there	are	a	few	specific
words	of	wisdom	Iâ€™d	love	to	share.
1.	Never,	ever	try	cutting	your	own	bangs.	So	thereâ€™s	this	movie	called	500
Days	of	Summer	that	will	come	out	in	2009	and	make	you/every	girl	in	the
universe	want	bangs	more	than	anything.	But	trust	me,	just	because	bangs
look	amazing	on	Zooey	Deschanel	does	NOT	mean	they	will	look	good	on
you.	When	you	make	that	fateful	snip,	youâ€™ll	discover	the	horrible	truth:
You	have	not	one,	but	TWO	cowlicks	on	either	side	of	your	forehead!	No
amount	of	product	will	save	you,	Teen	Jess.	And	you	will	spend	YEARS
waiting	for	that	shit	to	grow	out.	So	do	us	both	a	favor	and	back	away	from
the	scissors!	Youâ€™ve	been	warned.
2.	Shake	it	like	a	Polaroid	picture.	Take	advantage	of	your	teenage	hotness!
Dance	it	up!	Sing	it	up!	Live	it	up!	Flaunt	that	bikini	and	buy	that	hot	pink
miniskirt	youâ€™ve	been	eyeing	at	T.	J.	Maxx.	It	all	looks	amazing	on	you,	so
show	off	that	gravity-free	bod	while	you	can!	In	a	few	years	when	youâ€™re
slaving/daydreaming	in	an	office	cubicle,	youâ€™ll	so	wish	you	had.
3.	Sha-la-la-la-la-la,	donâ€™t	be	shy,	go	on	and	kiss	that	guy!	(Like	in	The
Little	Mermaid,	but	reversed!)	Donâ€™t	be	scared	of	guys,	Teen	Jess.	You	may
have	spent	years	at	an	all-girlsâ€™	school,	but	Iâ€™m	here	to	report	boys	arenâ€™t	all
that	different	from	your	average	household	pest	(hungry,	hairy,	and]]></text>

  <page pageNumber = "157">
     <text><![CDATA[helpless)!	And	trust	me,	theyâ€™re	JUST	as	scared	of	you	as	you	are	of	them.
4.	Party	like	itâ€™s	1999.	When	you	move	to	New	York,	a	wise	person	will	tell
you:	RSVP	yes	to	EVERYTHING.	So	true!	Unless	youâ€™re	literally	dying	of
malaria,	never	skip	out	on	a	partyâ€”even	one	you	think	will	be	lame.	Why?
Because	you	never	know	who	youâ€™re	going	to	meet!	I	wonâ€™t	spoil	the
surprise,	but	believe	me,	one	of	those	parties	will	change	your	life	more
than	you	could	possibly	imagineâ€¦in	a	good	way!
5.	Stop	obsessing.	Itâ€™s	totally	normal	to	worry	about	what	other	people
think	of	you.	But	I	swear,	the	only	people	whose	opinions	truly	matter	are
your	best	friends	and	family.	Forget	about	the	rest!	In	a	few	years,	high
school	will	feel	like	forever	ago.	The	world	is	enormous,	and	youâ€™ve	got
lots	of	awesome	adventures	ahead	of	you.	Sure,	youâ€™ll	make	some	mistakes
along	the	way.	(Thank	goodness,	because	otherwise	life	would	get	pretty
boring!)	So	in	those	stressful	moments,	just	take	a	deep	breath,	chillax,	and
do	your	best	to	ENJOY	THE	RIDE.	Youâ€™ll	be	glad	you	did.:	)

     <text><![CDATA[ALL	ROADS	LEAD	SOMEWHERE
Jennifer	Rush
Dear	Teen	Me,
In	the	fall	of	2001,	your	friend	will	call	you	late	at	night	and	ask	you	to	go	for	a
ride.	She	doesnâ€™t	have	a	destination.	Sheâ€™s	just	bored	and	wants	to	hang	out.
Hereâ€™s	my	first	bit	of	advice:	Go.
Around	2:00	am,	your	friend	will	take	the	highway	back	into	town.	The	road
stretches	on	for	twenty	miles,	but	you	know	that	somewhere	on	that	road	your
cousin	owns	a	house.	To	pass	the	time,	you	look	for	his	vehicle	in	the	slide	of
headlights.	Since	he	just	recently	moved	there,	youâ€™re	mostly	curious	to	see
what	the	place	looks	like.
Ten	minutes	from	the	main	road,	when	youâ€™ve	given	up	the	search,	youâ€™ll	see
flashing	red	and	blue	lights.
Hereâ€™s	my	next	bit	of	advice:	Sit	up.
Thereâ€™s	an	ambulance	in	a	dirt	driveway.	A	cop	car.	You	twist	around	as	you
pass.
â€œSomething	crazyâ€™s	going	down	there,â€	your	friend	says.
Donâ€™t	look	away.
An	hour	later,	back	at	home,	the	phone	will	ring.	â€œI	need	to	talk	to	your	mom,â€
your	aunt	says	in	a	voice	so	strained	you	can	barely	hear	her.
â€œSheâ€™s	sleepingâ€”â€
â€œWake	her	up.	Please.â€
You	rush	down	the	hallway.	Shake	your	mom	awake.	Hand	her	the	phone.	You
step	back	and	wait.	Wait.	And	wait.	Itâ€™ll	only	be	a	few	seconds,	but	itâ€™ll	seem
like	forever.
Just	when	you	think	you	canâ€™t	stand	it	any	longer,	your	mom	will	let	out	a
choked	sob	and	somehow	youâ€™ll	know	this	is	connected	to	the	cop	car,	to	the
ambulance.	Youâ€™ll	feel	it	in	your	heart	and	in	your	gut.]]></text>
  </page>
  <page pageNumber = "161">
     <text><![CDATA[â€œChadâ€™s	dead,â€	your	mom	will	say.	Your	cousin.	That	house	was	his.
He	committed	suicide,	youâ€™ll	learn.	He	was	your	favorite	and	you	let	him	know
it.	And	maybe	it	seemed	like	a	joke	to	the	family,	but	it	was	true.	You	adored
him.	He	was	smart.	And	funny.	And	happy.	Wasnâ€™t	he?	He	was	so	much	more
than	you	ever	thought	you	could	be.
Why	would	he	do	it?	youâ€™ll	wonder.	Why?	This	is	a	question	that	will	never
have	an	answer,	but	you	canâ€™t	stop	asking	it.
The	next	day,	youâ€™ll	be	lost	and	numb	and	everyone	will	be	crying	and	you
canâ€™t	take	the	crying.	Call	your	friend	Wes.	Call	him.	Heâ€™ll	help	you	escape.
At	dinnertime,	youâ€™ll	realize	you	havenâ€™t	eaten	all	day.	At	the	fast-food	place,
Wes	will	know	the	boy	behind	the	counter.	You	wonâ€™t	catch	his	name.	Heâ€™ll
give	you	extra	fries.	On	a	day	like	this,	the	fries	mean	more	than	they	normally
would.
Remember	him.	Itâ€™ll	be	a	hazy	memory,	but	keep	it	tucked	away.
Three	months	later,	a	boy	will	come	into	the	Laundromat	where	you	work.
Heâ€™ll	ask	you	out.	Say	yes.
It	will	take	you	a	few	weeks,	several	dates,	many	hours	spent	on	the	phone,
before	you	realize	he	was	the	boy	behind	the	counter.	The	one	who	gave	you
the	fries.	That	boy	will	become	your	husband.
Somehow,	on	one	of	the	worst	nights	of	your	life,	youâ€™ll	meet	the	most
important	person	in	your	life.	Fate	may	seem	a	silly	notion,	but	sometimes,
tiny,	inconspicuous	moments	will	connect	to	something	bigger,	something
profound.	So	my	last	bit	of	advice	is	this:	Take	nothing	for	granted.	Keep	your
heart	and	your	eyes	open.	You	never	know	when	youâ€™ll	meet	someone
extraordinary.	Or,	even	if	itâ€™s	for	a	second	in	the	dark,	in	a	car	on	the	highway,
youâ€™ll	get	your	only	chance	to	say	good-bye.

Amy	Kathleen	Ryan
Dear	Teen	Me,
I	know	you	hate	to	be	told	what	to	do	with	your	face.	Elderly	men	in	particular
love	telling	you	to	smileâ€”for	which	you	reward	them	with	a	sarcastic	smirk.
Good	work.	They	should	mind	their	own	business.	But	since	Iâ€™m	you,	and	your
face	is	mine,	I	have	every	right	to	make	this	suggestion:	Slap	a	grin	on	your
mug.
You	know	how	you	never	get	asked	out	on	dates?	Thatâ€™s	because	you	lurch
through	the	hallways	of	your	school	with	your	head	down	as	if	you	were
ducking	enemy	fire.
I	canâ€™t	blame	you.	High	school	isnâ€™t	easy.	Youâ€™ve	got	all	typesâ€”from
motorheads	to	eggheads	to	potheadsâ€”crammed	into	a	single	building	at	high
density,	and	you	have	to	get	through	the	day	without	erupting	into	civil	war.	I
have	news	for	you,	too:	Adults	wouldnâ€™t	be	able	to	do	it.	In	adulthood,	people
have	self-sorted	into	pockets	of	like-minded	compadres.	The	computer	geeks
work	together	at	Microsoft,	the	debate	members	have	all	joined	law	firms,	and
the	drama	kids	are	launching	off-off-Broadway	plays	in	Minneapolis.	So	donâ€™t
listen	to	adults	telling	you	these	are	the	best	years	of	your	life.	It	gets	infinitely
better	when	you	can	choose	what	you	do,	where,	and	with	whom.	But	until	that
day	comes,	smile!
Iâ€™m	not	saying	you	should	be	one	of	those	plastic,	ever-chipper	girls	who
bounce	through	the	hallway	swinging	their	ponytails	behind	them	like
bullwhips.	These	girls	will	grow	up	to	be	real	estate	agents,	politicians,	and
PTA	presidents.	Their	smiles	will	become	like	debit	cards,	earning	them
professional	capital,	but	depleting	them	in	the	soul	department.
Nonetheless,	there	are	occasions	when	it	would	be	eminently	appropriate	for
you	to	smile.	For	instance,	you	know	that	cute	guy	in	the	leather	jacket	who
was	ogling	you	at	the	football	game?	And	you	know	how	you	were	so	nervous
you	could	barely	glance	in	his	direction?	When	you	did	look	at	him,	it	was	oh
so	casually,	as	though	your	eye	was	actually	drawn	to	the	overboiled	hotdogs]]></text>

Did	it	never	once	occur	to	you	that	you	could	actually	smile	at	him?	Give	him	a
little	invitation?	A	little	facial	tic	that	says,	â€œHi.	I	am	receptive.	Please	initiate.â€
If	youâ€™d	managed	to	contort	your	frown	a	mere	thirty	degrees	upward,	he	might
be	dating	you	and	your	fuzzy	1980s	perm	right	now	(instead	of	that	girl	with
the	bubble	butt	and	colored	contacts).
Because	hereâ€™s	the	thing	I	donâ€™t	think	you	realize:	It	is	actually	possible	for	a
guy	to	be	attracted	to	you.	No,	youâ€™re	not	the	prettiest	girl	in	school.	And	youâ€™re
definitely	not	the	most	popular.	But	that	doesnâ€™t	mean	that	some	nice,	cute	guy
couldnâ€™t	notice	you.	And	if	you	encouraged	him	with	a	friendly	grin,	he	might
be	able	to	overcome	his	nervousness	enough	to	say	hi.	And	then	you	might
have	a	date	for	homecoming	instead	of	being	forced	to	hang	out	on	the
bleachers	with	your	wallflower	girlfriends	mouthing	the	lyrics	to	â€œForever
Young.â€
You	wonâ€™t	be,	you	know.	Your	looks	will	fade,	and	youâ€™ll	spend	money	on
creams	and	tinctures	to	try	and	buy	a	few	more	minutes	of	youthfulness.	Thatâ€™s
what	I	do	now	every	night;	I	scrub	away	dead	skin	cells	by	whatever	means
necessary.	Iâ€™m	trying	to	look	like	you.	Thatâ€™s	because	youâ€™re	beautiful.	All
teenage	girls	are	beautiful.	Your	eyes	are	clear.	Your	skin	is	wrinkle-free.
Youâ€™re	energetic	and	lovely	by	virtue	of	your	gorgeous,	enviable	youth.	So
donâ€™t	waste	it.	Pull	your	face	up	out	of	its	foxhole.	Take	a	chance	on	the	world.

Tom	Ryan
Dear	Teen	Me,
Let	me	get	this	out	of	the	way	first:	Youâ€™re	gay.	And	in	the	end,	youâ€™ll	come
out.	And	yes,	eventually	it	does	get	better.	Much	better.

of	a	lot	youâ€™ll	have	to	deal	with	in	the	meantime	before	youâ€™re	able	to	admit
who	you	really	are.
Thatâ€™s	what	I	want	to	talk	about	now:	the	meantime.
First	up:	Donâ€™t	stop	singing.	Please.
You	love	singing.	I	know	it.	I	know	that	the	first	thing	youâ€™ll	do	after	you	get
your	license	is	grab	your	favorite	mix	tape,	pop	it	in	the	tape	deck,	and	drive
around	by	yourself	singing	along	(at	the	top	of	your	mother-freaking	lungs)	to
Fleetwood	Mac,	Aerosmith,	and	Roxette.
You	love	dancing	too,	right?	Jumping	up	and	down	and	feeling	like	a	superstar
in	the	movie	of	your	life?
You	like	to	bake	cookies	and	decorate	cakes.	You	like	sassy	female	comedians.
You	like	to	watch	figure	skating.	You	write	poetry	about	sunsets	over	the
ocean.	Do	you	get	where	Iâ€™m	going	with	this?
Yep.	You	love	a	whole	bunch	of	supergay	shit.
And	thatâ€™s	okay,	despite	what	the	voice	has	to	say.
You	know	exactly	what	Iâ€™m	talking	about.	The	nasty	little	voice	in	the	back	of
your	head	that	tells	you	to	rein	it	in,	to	try	acting	straight.	The	voice	that	tells
you	that	the	things	you	love	and	the	thoughts	you	think	make	you	worthlessâ€”
an	embarrassment.	The	voice	that	says	you	should	be	ashamed	of	yourself.
Worst	of	all,	the	voice	will	tell	you,	day	and	night,	that	if	you	donâ€™t	watch	your
step,	then	people	will	start	to	see	who	you	really	are.

ADVICE
Leila	Sales
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™re	probably	hoping	that	Iâ€™m	writing	to	youâ€”from	the	futureâ€”with	words
of	advice,	sage	wisdom	I	have	picked	up	over	my	years	as	an	adult	which	will
somehow	save	you	from	all	embarrassing	and	depressing	situations.	I	should	do
that,	shouldnâ€™t	I?	It	would	be	really	nice	of	me	to	help	you	be	a	more	well
adjusted	person.
The	trouble	with	that	is,	when	I	think	of	advice	I	could	give	you,	I	mostly	come
up	with	things	for	you	not	to	do.
For	example,	when	the	boy	youâ€™ve	had	a	crush	on	for	two	years	rests	his	elbow
on	your	shoulder,	do	not	respond	by	saying,	â€œArenâ€™t	you	a	little	short	for	that?â€
Yes,	that	will	remove	his	arm,	but	it	will	also	remove	any	chance	you	might
have	had	of	going	out	with	him.
Do	not	write	long	letters	to	every	girl	in	your	bunk	at	camp,	or	to	every	member
of	your	graduating	class,	in	which	you	explain	to	them	how	much	you	care
about	them	and	explain	how	they	can	still	improve	themselves.	This	is	weird,
and	nobody	will	appreciate	it.	You	are	actually	not	an	expert	on	other	peopleâ€™s
character	flaws.	Furthermore,	writing	fifty	letters	is	a	huge	time	investment,	and
you	could	probably	spend	those	hours	doing	something	more	useful,	like
learning	how	to	cook	(which	you	still	do	not	know	how	to	do,	sorry).
Do	not	go	on	a	self-loathing	spree	after	you	get	rejected	from	your	four	top-
choice	colleges.	Itâ€™s	not	because	youâ€™re	worthless	and	unappreciated;	itâ€™s
because	getting	into	college	is	hard.
Do	not	pull	out	in	front	of	that	school	bus	when	thereâ€™s	a	police	car	directly
behind	you.	Thatâ€™s	a	one-hundred-dollar	ticket,	Teen	Me.	You	could	use	that
hundred	dollars,	if	you	still	had	it	today.	You	could	buy	yourself	a	new	iPod.
(Teen	Me,	iPods	are	this	amazing	technology	that	let	you	carry	around
thousands	of	songs	instead	of	just	a	few	CDs.	I	mean	it.	The	future	is	a	crazy]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[place.)
Anyway.	I	could	go	on.	You	make	a	lot	of	mistakes	as	a	teenager,	itâ€™s	true,	and
you	make	some	enemies	as	well.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	I	donâ€™t	actually	want	you
to	avoid	those	mistakes.	Because	then	you	would	have	nothing	to	write	about.
Even	if	I	could	instruct	you	on	how	to	get	through	high	school	without
offending	a	single	one	of	your	classmates,	without	scaring	off	a	single	boy,
without	angering	any	of	your	teachersâ€”even	then,	I	wouldnâ€™t	do	it.	Because
each	time	you	ate	lunch	alone	in	the	library	or	totally	botched	a	stage	kiss,	you
were	giving	yourself	the	materials	you	now	need	as	a	novelist.
Eventually	every	one	of	your	missteps,	and	every	person	who	wouldnâ€™t	give
you	the	time	of	day,	will	make	their	way	into	your	books.	And	teenagers	all
over	the	world	will	read	those	books,	and	some	will	even	say	things	like,	â€œI
love	this	book.	Leila	Sales	seems	really	cool.â€	Iâ€™m	serious.	If	you	give	it
enough	time,	teenagers	will	think	you	are	cool.	It	wonâ€™t	be	while	youâ€™re	a
teenager,	but	still.
So	do	exactly	what	youâ€™re	doing.	Make	every	mistake	youâ€™re	making,	but	also
learn	from	them,	remember	them,	and	use	them.
Two	exceptions	to	that	advice:
Do	not	be	so	bitchy	to	your	dad.
And	do	not	blow-dry	the	life	out	of	your	hair	every	day.	Your	hair	is	curly,	and
it	looks	good	curly.	Forcing	it	to	be	something	that	itâ€™s	not	isnâ€™t	fooling
anybody.
Other	than	those	two	things,	just	carry	on	as	you	were.	Mistakes	and	all.

Cynthia	Leitich	Smith
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™ve	had	enough	of	the	quarters	game	in	the	kitchen,	the	â€œPink	Floydâ€	album
in	the	rec	room,	and	the	whispers	and	stares	everywhere	else.	A	girl	on	your
high	school	newspaper	staff	just	told	you	he	was	here.	You	have	to	get	away.
Youâ€™re	not	ready	to	see	him	yet.
Itâ€™s	more	than	that	actually.	Youâ€™re	not	ready	for	everyone	else	to	dissect	how
you	two	interactâ€¦or	donâ€™t.	Maybe	that	sounds	superficial,	but	this	is	social
theater,	and	youâ€™re	the	leading	lady	of	the	week.	Youâ€™re	not	about	to	let	them
see	you	crumble.
What	are	you	doing	here	anyway?	You	barely	know	the	girl	whose	parents
(currently	out	of	town)	own	this	place.	Maybe	your	best	friend	had	a	point:
Moping	at	home	wasnâ€™t	helping,	but	offering	yourself	up	as	the	focus	of
tonightâ€™s	drama	wasnâ€™t	the	best	idea	either.
For	the	first	time,	a	boyfriend	has	told	you	that	he	doesnâ€™t	want	you	anymore.
Youâ€™ve	been	together	for	months.	Youâ€™ve	gone	on	countless	variations	of	his
preferred	date:	dinner	at	a	chain	restaurant	followed	by	the	yogurt	shop	or
miniature	golf.	Youâ€™ve	been	to	church	with	his	family,	and	heâ€™s	celebrated	the
holidays	with	yours.	Your	parents	like	him,	especially	your	dad.	They	connect
over	football.
Was	it	because	youâ€™re	a	virgin?	Is	that	why	he	dumped	you?	He	never
pressured.	He	never	even	brought	it	up.	But	thatâ€™s	what	your	gut	says.
In	your	suburban	high	school,	it	seems	like	a	cheerleader	gets	pregnant	every
single	year.	Youâ€™re	horrified	by	how	people	turn	their	backs	on	those	girls,	and
youâ€™re	determined	that	it	wonâ€™t	happen	to	you.	Could	he	sense	that?
The	split-level	house	is	crowded.	You	squeeze	past	drunken	kids	to	reach	the
second	floor.	Someone	asks	if	you	know	heâ€™s	there,	and	you	pretend	not	to
hear.	Couples	are	making	out	in	the	bathroom	and	in	the	bedrooms	you	pass.
You	slip	into	the	master,	where	coats	and	purses	are	piled	on	the	bed,	and	shut]]></text>

You	need	a	few	moments	to	pull	yourself	together.	Itâ€™s	already	late.	You
consider	hiding	out	there	until	your	friends	are	ready	to	leave.
Then	the	door	opens.	Of	all	people,	itâ€™s	the	girl	whoâ€™s	been	bullying	you	from
the	day	you	first	moved	to	this	district,	back	in	fourth	grade.	She	spray-painted
the	word	â€œBitchâ€	on	your	driveway,	and	mocked	your	discount-store	clothes.
Thatâ€™s	why	youâ€™re	a	cheerleader.	You	tried	out	for	the	wardrobe	that	came	with
it.	Who	wouldâ€™ve	guessed	youâ€™d	take	away	her	spot	on	the	squad?
After	that,	she	faded	into	the	background.	Until	tonight.	Has	she	been	waiting
for	the	opportunity	to	attack?	You	feel	exposed,	vulnerable.
â€œYouâ€™re	too	good	for	him,â€	she	announces,	and	you	assume	itâ€™s	a	trick.
You	brace	yourself	for	the	punch	line.	You	brace	yourself	to	be	the	punch	line,
like	you	had	been	for	many	years	before.	But	it	doesnâ€™t	come.	Sheâ€™s	sincere.
Has	the	world	turned	upside	down?
â€œWhy	are	you,	of	all	people,	being	nice	to	me?â€	you	demand	with	more	spirit
than	youâ€™ve	ever	shown	her,	toe-to-toe,	before.
She	blames	the	past	on	jealousy.	She	tells	you	how	much	you	wow	her.
Itâ€™s	a	small	miracle.	If	she	can	change,	then	you	will,	too.	No	more	hiding.	You
go	downstairs	to	confront	the	boy.	To	ask	what	went	wrong.
Years	later,	you	wonâ€™t	care	enough	to	remember	what	he	said.
In	the	end,	that	wonâ€™t	be	the	conversation	that	mattered.

Jessica	Spotswood
Dear	Teen	Me,
You	are	a	truly	whimsical	being.	You	wish	upon	a	star	every	Christmas	Eve
(and	on	fireworks	during	the	Fourth	of	July).	You	read	Victoria	Holt	and	Judith
McNaught	and	Gone	with	the	Wind,	over	and	over	again.	Youâ€™ve	never	been
kissed,	but	you	write	sprawling	historical	romance	novels	filled	with	flirtatious
banter	and	spirited,	thinly	veiled	Scarlett	Oâ€™Haras.
You	want	to	fall	in	love.
All	of	your	best	friends	are	dating.	Youâ€™re	simultaneously	envious	of	and
annoyed	by	their	constant	PDAs.	When	their	romances	are	going	well	they
donâ€™t	need	you;	but	when	they	fall	apart,	your	friends	get	all	devastated	and
depressed	and	make	very	questionable	decisions.	Their	entire	sense	of	self-
worth	seems	hinged	on	these	relationships,	and	you	donâ€™t	ever	want	to	be	like
that.	You	swear	that	when	you	fall	in	love,	you	wonâ€™t	lose	yourself.
Your	stepmom	says	youâ€™re	the	type	of	girl	who	will	marry	her	first	serious
boyfriend,	and	you	know	what?	Sheâ€™s	right.
It	will	take	a	while	for	you	to	find	him,	though.	Right	now	youâ€™re	going	through
a	succession	of	crushes	on	boys	who	only	see	you	as	a	friend,	and	who
therefore	donâ€™t	think	itâ€™s	at	all	awkward	to	confide	in	you	about	their	crushes	on

crushes,	which	will	make	you	feel	small	and	stupid	when	they	are	not
reciprocated.	Youâ€™ll	become	as	cynical	as	you	are	capable	of	being	(which	is
not	very,	because	youâ€™re	inherently	optimistic).	You	will	want	to	murder
anyone	who	calls	you	cute,	because	cute	seems	naÃ¯ve.
The	boy	who	will	become	our	husband,	the	Playwrightâ€”he	is	brilliant	and
witty	and	he	never	says	what	you	expect	him	to.	Itâ€™s	maddening;	you	canâ€™t

Erika	Stalder
Dear	Teen	Me,
Letâ€™s	talk	about	boys.	I	know,	I	knowâ€”you	think	the	topic	is	overhyped	and
undervalued.	And	youâ€™re	annoyed	that	seemingly	all	the	chicks	around	you	are
consumedâ€”consumed!â€”by	boy	stuff.	I	really	canâ€™t	blame	you	for	thinking
â€œGawdâ€”enough	already!â€	What	with	your	best	friend	dating	a	twenty-five-
year-old	gangster	with	jailhouse	tattoos	and	a	gunplay	fetish	(not	to	mention	a
thing	for	MUCH	younger,	virginal	girlsâ€”gross!),	and	your	carpool	buddy	who
rhapsodizes	on	and	on	about	her	boy	exploitsâ€¦Itâ€™s	pretty	exhausting.
And	of	course	it	doesnâ€™t	help	that	your	first	date	was	with	a	guy	who	drove	a
windowless	van	(which	he	borrowed),	and	who	didnâ€™t	bring	enough	money	to
even	cover	his	own	tab.	Or	that	most	of	the	hotties	in	your	tiny	school	act	like
dopey	surfer	brahs	who	consume	beerios	(yes,	thatâ€™s	Cheerios	in	beerâ€”ugh)	for
breakfast.	But	humor	me.
Try	to	be	nicer	to	the	boys	in	your	school.	Even	though	the	boy	frontier	is
tumultuous,	embarrassingly	underexplored,	and	sometimes	a	downright	hassle,
high	school	guys	are	trying	to	get	by	just	like	you.	Theyâ€™re	worried	about
whether	their	V	cards	have	surpassed	the	socially	acceptable	use-by	date.	And
theyâ€™ve	all	got	that	girl	they	desperately	want	to	talk	to	but	are	terrified	of
approaching,	just	because	they	might	be	rejected.	And	despite	the	amount	of
misplaced	innuendo	and	attaboying	they	engage	in,	these	guys	can	be	sincere.
Sometimes,	when	a	guy	tells	you	that	you	look	pretty,	he	means	it,	and	you
should	simply	thank	him	instead	of	knowing	that	heâ€™s	messing	with	you	and
flashing	your	signature	â€œdonâ€™t	eff	with	meâ€	glare.
And	for	Godâ€™s	sakeâ€”when	youâ€™re	at	that	post-lip-sync	party	with	your	crush,
make	a	move!	I	know	youâ€™re	all	worried	about	ruining	your	friendship	with	the
guy,	but	after	high	school,	youâ€™ll	never	talk	to	him	againâ€”so	that	friendship
isnâ€™t	as	important	as	you	think.	Whatâ€™s	more,	when	you	see	him	a	year	or	so
outta	high	school,	you	wonâ€™t	even	think	heâ€™s	cute	anymoreâ€”so	get	him	while
the	gettinâ€™s	good!	Not	only	will	he	likely	go	for	a	little	action,	but	making	the

Dear	Teen	Me,
Looking	a	little	chunky,	arenâ€™t	ya?
Before	that	guy	in	junior	English	class	said	that	to	you,	youâ€™d	had	some	fleeting
worries	about	your	thighs	being	a	little	too	big.	Your	hips	just	a	touch	too
curvy.	But	youâ€™d	just	grown	into	a	real	bra	size	the	summer	before.	You	felt
feminine,	confident,	strong.
Right	up	to	that	comment.
Those	words	are	going	to	haunt	you	for	a	long	time.	Every	time	you	look	at
yourself	in	the	mirror,	youâ€™ll	hear	his	voice:	â€œLooking	a	little	chunky,	arenâ€™t
ya?â€
Not	that	you	want	to	admit	to	yourself	or	to	anyone	else	that	one	stupid	guy	has
the	power	to	hurt	you	like	that.	Especially	one	you	had	a	crush	onâ€”a	fleeting
emotion	that	crashed	and	burned	point-two	seconds	after	he	said	that	to	you.
But	theyâ€™re	just	words,	right?	Thatâ€™s	what	you	told	yourself	that	day	as	you	bit
back	the	sting,	blinked	away	the	tears,	slipped	into	your	seat,	and	stared	blindly
ahead,	your	cheeks	burning	hot	with	humiliation.	Theyâ€™re	just	words,	and	words
canâ€™t	hurt.
You	never	saw	yourself	the	same	way	again	after	that,	though.	Your	lens	was
broken.
I	look	back	on	you,	remembering	the	way	you	studied	every	inch	of	your

were	skinnier.	And	I	feel	sick	that	your	view	of	yourself	became	skewed
because	of	what	one	(thoughtless)	person	thought	of	you.
Because	after	that,	you	didnâ€™t	dress	for	fun,	for	flair.	You	dressed	to	accentuate
the	good	and	conceal	the	bad.
It	wasnâ€™t	about	personal	statement.	It	was	camouflage.	It	was	illusion.
Whatâ€™s	even	worse	is	that	you	werenâ€™t	chunky.	You	were	healthy.	You	were]]></text>

Not	you,	though.	You	lost	almost	all	of	your	power	and	your	self-confidence

that.
Embrace	your	curves.	They	reflect	your	unique	femininity.	Your	body	is

Mariko	Tamaki
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™re	fifteen	years	old,	and	you	want	to	die.
Just	so	you	know,	not	a	lot	of	people	know	this	about	you.	People	see	you	with
your	book,	sitting	in	the	windowsill.	They	see	you	writing	poetry	in	your	poetry
binder.	They	see	your	picture	in	the	yearbook,	bangs	in	your	face,	slouched	in
the	back	row.	But	thatâ€™s	all	they	see.
No	one	knows	how	sad	you	are.	Your	parents	donâ€™t	even	know	youâ€™re	sad	at
all,	mostly	because	you	avoid	themâ€”preferring	to	snack	on	cereal	and	soy
sauce	(separately)	in	your	room.
Of	course,	you	have	your	reasons	for	keeping	to	yourself.	Girls	are	so	mean	in
grade	school.	Later	on	youâ€™ll	marvel	at	this	phenomenon,	watching	a	new
generation	of	teenagers	from	a	safe	distance,	while	teaching	creative	writing.
But	at	fifteen,	this	cruelty	feels	overwhelmingly	close.	And	you	feel	so
incredibly	vulnerable.
What	Iâ€™m	trying	to	say	is	that	yes,	it	obviously	makes	sense	to	try	and	avoid
them,	to	stay	hidden	in	the	camouflage	of	a	shadow.	To	keep	quiet.
But	hereâ€™s	the	thing.	You	keep	quiet	instead	of	expressing	yourself	(which	is
only	a	little	ironic	because	youâ€™re	also	a	huge	fan	of	Madonna).	You	keep	quiet
instead	of	saying	things	you	think	are	funny,	because	youâ€™re	afraid	people
wonâ€™t	get	the	joke	and	will	think	youâ€™re	weird.	You	keep	your	heart	tucked	into
your	sleeve	instead	of	being	honest	about	the	things	and	the	people	(the	girls)
that	you	love,	because	being	open	about	this	stuff	seems	like	a	surefire
invitation	for	attack.
But	this	is	not	a	solution.	Itâ€™s	a	problem,	and	itâ€™s	what	makes	you	start	to	think
about	suicideâ€”about	getting	away	for	good.
And	let	me	tell	you	something,	as	soon	as	you	stop	being	quiet,	as	soon	as	you
stop	hiding,	and	hiding	who	you	are,	things	will	change.
Before	this	happens,	though,	youâ€™re	going	to	experience	a	real	crisis.	Youâ€™ll]]></text>

diagnosed	with	depression.	And	it	will	seem	like	an	insurmountable	diagnosis.
But	itâ€™s	wonâ€™t	be.	Instead,	by	hitting	rock	bottom	at	fifteen,	youâ€™ll	quickly	learn
how	silly	it	is	to	be	afraid.
After	the	hospital	youâ€™ll	suddenly	feel	like	you	have	nothing	to	lose.	Hiding
your	true	self	will	seem	like	a	ridiculous	task,	because	everyone	will	now	have
PROOF	that	you	are	different.	Youâ€™ll	be	legitimately,	REALLY,	crazy.
Everyone	at	school	will	know	you	had	to	be	admitted	to	the	hospital.	The
â€œwhyâ€	will	vary	according	to	which	particular	rumor	people	choose	to	believe.
So,	youâ€™ll	think,	â€œWho	cares?	So	Iâ€™m	nuts.	SO	WHAT?â€
First	youâ€™ll	find	your	lookâ€”a	punk	rock,	artsy,	goth-type	thing.	Youâ€™ll	discover
the	joys	of	eyeliner	as	lipstick.	Youâ€™ll	wear	little	old	lady	dresses	and	striped
tights.	Youâ€™ll	buy	ten-hole	purple	Doc	Martens	and	wear	them	to	bed	because
you	love	them	so	much.	Youâ€™ll	discover	the	joys	of	being	the	strangest	person
in	the	room.	Youâ€™ll	dye	your	hair	purple.
Three	years	later	youâ€™ll	go	to	university	and	meet	and	fall	in	love	with	a	girl
who	dyes	her	hair	pink.
And,	just	so	you	know,	even	though	no	one	gets	your	jokes	in	high	school,
people	will	TOTALLY	(mostly)	get	them	later	on.
As	your	future	self,	I	can	make	this	promise:	Things	will	TOTALLY	get	better.
Have	a	little	faith	in	yourself.	So	stop	hiding.	Stop	being	quiet.	Be	brave.

ESTEEM
Don	Tate
Dear	Teen	Me,
Hey	there,	Donny	Tate!	Iâ€™m	sorry	to	interrupt	while	you	paint.	I	know	how
focused	you	are	in	art	mode,	but	we	need	to	talk.	I	am	you,	thirty	years	later.
My	hair	is	grayer,	my	face	is	fuller,	my	pants	are	a	few	sizes	larger.	But	Iâ€™m
still	hereâ€”weâ€™re	still	hereâ€”alive	and	kicking	in	2012.	Weâ€™re	lucky,	though,
â€˜cause	you	almost	messed	it	up	for	the	both	of	us.
You	sit	there	at	seventeen-years-old	in	your	high	school	art	class.	All	decked
out	in	your	Playboy	shirt,	Leviâ€™s	jeans,	penny	loafer	shoes.	We	dressed	to
impress.	But	somethingâ€™s	wrong	with	this	picture,	and	you	and	I	both	know	it.
You	stole	those	jeans	(â€¦and	the	shirtâ€¦and	the	shoes).	And	you	smell	like	an
ashtray	after	cutting	gym	class	to	smoke	cigarettes	in	the	parking	lot	with	your
boys.
Iâ€™m	not	trying	to	out	you,	but	if	Iâ€™m	going	to	help	you	get	on	the	right	track,	I
need	to	be	real.
Iâ€™m	writing	this	letter	to	give	you	a	piece	of	adviceâ€”something	you	and	I	will
learn	the	hard	way,	after	many	years	of	bad	decisions:	You	donâ€™t	need	to	prove
anything	to	anyone	but	God	and	yourself.
Donâ€™t	worry,	Iâ€™m	not	getting	all	church-boy	on	you,	so	wipe	the	attitude	off
your	face.	(Youâ€™re	just	like	your	daughterâ€”the	one	youâ€™ve	already	conceived	at
seventeen	and	donâ€™t	even	know	about	yet.)	Listen,	you	spend	way	too	much
time	trying	to	impress	others.	For	example,	that	stuff	you	stoleâ€”you	didnâ€™t
need	it.	You	have	two	jobs.	You	stole	to	impress	your	friends.	And	they	were
impressed.	So	much	so,	they	pressed	you	to	steal	stuff	for	them,	too.	Clothes,
electronics,	hair	care	products.	Whatever	they	wanted,	you	got	it	for	them.	But
where	were	those	â€œfriendsâ€	when	the	police	showed	up	and	you	got	fined	for

Melissa	Walker
Dear	Teen	Me,
Youâ€™re	right	about	almost	everything.	I	know	it	and	you	know	it.	But	the	truth
is,	youâ€™re	wrong	about	almost	everything,	too.	Life	is	slippery	that	way,	so	letâ€™s
break	down	some	of	your	core	beliefs:
Youâ€™ll	never	get	over	your	first	love.
Why	youâ€™re	right:	Heâ€™s	pretty	awesome.	Heâ€™s	hot,	he	makes	you	laugh,	and	he
understands	what	youâ€™re	thinking	with	just	a	glance.	No	one	will	ever	know	you
in	the	same	way	that	he	does	right	now.	Thereâ€™s	no	getting	over	a	first	love.
Thereâ€™s	only	holding	the	memory	of	it	close	and	making	it	a	part	of	the	fabric	of
the	rest	of	your	life.
Why	youâ€™re	wrong:	Breaking	up	with	him	will	not	mean	leaving	yourself
damaged	in	an	irreparable	way.	You	donâ€™t	have	to	get	over	a	first	love,	you	just
have	to	move	on	from	him.	And	you	donâ€™t	have	to	rupture	all	your	ties	to	him	in
order	to	do	that.	After	the	breakup,	with	a	little	time,	you	can	even	be	friends
again.	(And	by	the	way,	Iâ€™m	not	just	blowing	smoke	up	your	ass:	Youâ€™ll	dance
with	him	at	your	wedding,	and	heâ€™ll	wind	up	being	a	close	friend	of	your
husbandâ€™s.)
Youâ€™ll	never	have	friends	this	close	again.
Why	youâ€™re	right:	These	people	are	hilarious	and	awesome	and	most	of	them
have	known	you	since	you	were	five.	Itâ€™s	hard	to	compete	with	that.	The	good
news	is,	friendship	is	not	a	competition.
Why	youâ€™re	wrong:	Youâ€™ll	make	amazing	friends	in	college	and	in	your
twenties,	and	youâ€™ll	become	even	closer	friends	with	them	than	you	were	with
your	high	school	friends,	albeit	in	different	ways.	And	theyâ€™ll	make	you	laugh
just	as	hard	as	you	did	before.	Theyâ€™ll	all	be	additions,	not	replacements,	so

Jo	Whittemore
Dear	Teen	Me,
Right	now	youâ€™re	dabbing	on	Charlie	perfume	and	hiking	your	jeans	all	the
way	upâ€”only	inches	away	from	camel-toe	status.	Youâ€™re	smart	enough,	thank
GodÂ¸	to	know	that	camel	toe	isnâ€™t	sexy,	but	for	some	reason	you	think	that
supertight	jeans	are.	Never	mind	that	your	pockets	canâ€™t	hold	anything	thicker
than	a	stick	of	gum	or	that	your	legs	hurt	when	you	sit	down.
You	think	youâ€™re	sexy.	And	we	can	blame	Janet	Jackson	for	that.
Sheâ€™s	all	the	rage	at	the	moment,	with	â€œRhythm	Nationâ€	and	â€œBlack	Catâ€
topping	the	charts,	and	her	music	videos	are	hot.	Sheâ€™s	sexy,	and	you	want	to	be
sexy,	too.
This	means	lace-up	boots,	tight	clothes,	and	killer	dance	moves.	Your
specialty?	The	box	step.	You	even	diagrammed	the	moves,	because	nothing
says	â€œtake	me	nowâ€	like	drawings	of	feet	and	arrows.	Unfortunately,	you	wonâ€™t
learn	until	years	later	that	the	box	step	is	for	ballroom	dancing,	but	it	explains
why	people	at	prom	thought	you	were	a	complete	dork.	(Thereâ€™s	now	a	reality
show	that	makes	ballroom	dancing	cool.	You	were	simply	ahead	of	your	time.)
Looking	back,	I	cringe	at	the	other	ways	youâ€™ll	try	to	be	sexy:	practicing	a
sultry	lip	bite	(with	buck	teeth,	you	resemble	a	rabbit),	hitting	guys	playfully	on
the	shoulder	(you	hit	harder	than	you	think),	and	crossing	your	legs	slowly	Ã 	la
Basic	Instinct	(you	look	like	you	have	pelvic	arthritis).
At	one	point,	youâ€™ll	even	make	sexy	eating	noises	because	you	saw	a	woman	do
it	in	a	yogurt	commercial.	The	guy	youâ€™re	dating	will	laughâ€”hardâ€”and	ask
why	youâ€™re	trying	to	be	sexy	with	a	rotisserie	chicken.	Even	though	he	turns	out
to	be	a	douchebag,	he	was	right	about	the	chicken.	Donâ€™t	eat	poultry	like	that.
Then	a	strange	thing	will	happen.	Youâ€™ll	give	up	trying	to	be	sexy,	because	the
attitude	that	goes	with	it	just	isnâ€™t	you.	And	youâ€™ll	miss	being	able	to	carry	stuff
in	your	pockets.
This	attitude	shift	makes	me	proud.]]></text>

â€œWhy	bother	at	all?â€	youâ€™ll	think.	â€œNobody	will	ever	find	me	sexy.â€
And	itâ€™s	just	not	true.
Once	your	best	friend	convinces	you	to	throw	away	the	ball	cap	and	brush	your
hair,	youâ€™ll	discover	a	happy	medium.	Youâ€™ll	grow	more	comfortable	in	your

way	to	break	the	ice	with	strangers.	Funny	anecdotes	about	your	past	will	turn
these	strangers	into	friends.
And	guys	will	start	to	notice	you	more.
Because,	apparently,	humor	is	also	sexy.	A	girl	who	can	laugh	at	her	own
shortcomings	and	be	herself	is	just	as	hot	as	one	who	can	synchronize	her	arm
and	leg	movements.
In	fact,	there	are	all	kinds	of	sexy:	smart,	funny,	sporty,	toughâ€¦
And	it	fits	all	sizes,	all	shapes.	Sexy	is	you,	the	real	you.	Why	be	anyone	else?

making	them	will	keep	your	hands	busy	during	those	late-night	babysitting	gigs
when	the	only	other	option	is	raiding	the	fridge.	(Speaking	of	Things	to	Do
While	Babysitting,	please	stop	watching	movies	like	Poltergeist	and	The
Amityville	Horror	when	youâ€™re	alone	in	a	dark	house!	Just	because	this	family
has	HBO	doesnâ€™t	mean	you	have	to	watch	it.)
I	just	want	you	to	think	about	this:	What	is	a	friend?
It	can	be	hard	to	know	sometimes.	The	nature	of	friendship	changes	as	you
move	toward	adulthood.
Childhood	friendships	were	often	based	on	proximity,	what	you	like	to	do	for
fun,	how	your	moms	feel	about	each	other.	Donâ€™t	get	me	wrongâ€”a	couple	of
those	childhood	friendships	were	great,	memorable,	so	much	fun,	and	so
important.	Rachel,	for	example.	And	of	course	Christine,	who	youâ€™ll	still	be	in
touch	with	when	youâ€™re	fortyâ€”and	even	though	you	arenâ€™t	best,	best	friends
like	you	were	in	childhood,	it	feels	so	good	to	still	be	known	by	someone	who
knew	you	when	you	were	four.
As	you	get	older,	what	youâ€™re	really	looking	for	is	someone	who	understands
you,	with	whom	you	feel	a	flash	of	recognition	and	a	sense	of	home.	And	Sara?
Iâ€™m	going	to	tell	you	this,	and	itâ€™s	not	a	criticism:	You	are	not	a	person	who	is
easily	understoodâ€”by	yourself	or	by	others.	But	being	understood	matters
enough	to	you	that	youâ€™ll	go	through	a	lot	of	pain	and	work	to	know	yourself,
and	youâ€™ll	make	some	missteps	in	your	efforts	to	be	known	by	others.
Iâ€™m	not	going	to	tell	you	about	those	missteps,	though,	or	warn	you	against
them.	Each	misstep	shows	you	something	about	yourself	that	you	needed	to
know,	and	refines	your	vision	of	what	you	want	in	a	friend,	which	brings	you
closer	to	finding	those	people,	that	person.
As	for	what	makes	a	friend,	thereâ€™s	no	ultimate	definition.	Friendships	come	in]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[a	lot	of	shapes	and	sizes.	There	are	friends	that	are	perfect	for	eating	lunch	with,
friends	you	meet	in	a	mutual	endeavorâ€”like	at	work	or	in	theater	or	musicâ€”
friends	to	party	and	play	with,	friends	who	are	good	companions	on	road	trips.
The	longevity	of	these	types	of	friendships	tends	to	be	limited	by	their	context,
but	thereâ€™s	no	shame	or	failure	in	that.
If	there	is	any	definition	of	a	True	Friend,	maybe	itâ€™s	this:	a	person	who
understands	the	kind	of	person	you	want	to	be,	and	whose	words	and	actions
toward	you	are	always	guided	by	that	understanding.
I	do	want	to	tell	you	what	a	friend	isnâ€™t,	though	I	know	youâ€™re	going	to	have	to
do	the	work	of	figuring	this	out	on	your	own:	A	friend	isnâ€™t	a	person	whose
attention	and	approval	you	depend	on	to	feel	okay	about	yourself.
This	is	a	hard	one	to	work	out.	Because	Dad	rejected	youâ€”not	outright,	not
intentionally,	but	through	neglect	and	the	effects	of	alcoholismâ€”some	injured
part	of	you	is	always	going	to	be	looking	for	someone	(usually	a	man	but	not
always)	to	make	you	feel	okay.	Even	if	everyone	in	the	world	tells	you	that
youâ€™re	okay	(and	you	are	going	to	have	a	great	career	that	earns	you	a	lot	of
attention	and	approval),	sometimes	itâ€™s	not	going	to	feel	like	enough.
This	is	going	to	lead	to	pain.
I	sort	of	wish	I	could	save	you	from	that	pain,	but	to	paraphrase	C.	S.	Lewis,	the
pain	now	is	part	of	the	joy	later.	And	thereâ€™s	going	to	be	joy,	too,	in	the	very
midst	of	pain,	because	you	are	going	to	be	blessed	with	a	number	of	very
meaningful	friendshipsâ€”some	of	which	began	from	that	place	of	needing
approval	but	then	grew	beyond	that	and	became	real.
However,	not	all	of	them	are	lasting,	and	even	though	youâ€™ll	think	youâ€™re	going
to	die	when	some	of	those	friendships	come	to	an	end,	you	wonâ€™t.	Youâ€™ll	come
out	alive,	stronger,	better	for	the	years	that	you	had	together,	full	of	self-
knowledge	you	wouldnâ€™t	have	discovered	any	other	way.	And	self-knowledge
is	going	to	be	really	important	for	the	work	that	youâ€™ll	end	up	doing.
No,	I	canâ€™t	save	you	from	pain.	But	maybe	you	could	at	least	think	about	these
words	from	Naomi	Shihab	Nye	when	youâ€™re	trying	to	discern	who	to	share
yourself	with:
You	Have	to	Be	Careful.	
You	have	to	be	careful	telling	things.	
Some	ears	are	tunnels.	
Your	words	will	go	in	and	get	lost	in	the	dark.]]></text>

CHANGE	A	THING
Jennifer	Ziegler
Dear	Teen	Me,
Back	away	from	the	curling	iron!	Back	away	now!
I	know,	I	know.	Youâ€™re	going	for	the	Ã¼ber-tousled	Belinda	Carlisle	look.	Wild
random	curls	that	will	reveal	a	confidence	you	donâ€™t	yet	possess	and	a	madcap
personality	youâ€™ll	never	have.	Why	do	you	bother?	You	know	very	well	that	by
your	10:00	am	history	class,	your	hair	will	be	as	limp	as	a	mopâ€™s	head.
Your	tenacity	is	to	be	admired,	however.	Youâ€™re	like	a	physicist,	experimenting
day	after	day,	trying	to	hit	upon	that	magical	combination	of	heat	and	hair	spray
that	will	allow	your	dishwater-blond	locks	to	defy	gravityâ€”and	genetics.	But
believe	me,	nothing	will	work.
You	have	straight	hair,	sweetie.	Not	sleek,	shiny	Pocahontas	straight	either.
Straight	meaning	that	it	just	hangs	there,	curl-free,	but	with	enough	kink	to
thwart	the	Indian	princess	look.	At	least	youâ€™re	not	alone	in	your	failings.	Your
school	is	full	of	fine-haired	girls	drooping	out	of	their	Madonna	headbands.
What?	Whatâ€™s	that	youâ€™re	saying?	A	home	perm?!
Dear	God,	no!	Their	toxic	contents	will	mutate	you	into	a	longwool	sheep!	On
especially	humid	days,	your	hair	will	have	lift	without	curl.	Youâ€™ll	be	a	walking
Chia	Pet!	Put	it	down!	Put	it	down,	I	say!
Now	letâ€™s	talk	makeup.
Again,	youâ€™re	going	for	the	look	of	an	MTV	pop	starâ€”but	the	end	result	is
moreâ€¦scary	clown.	Boy	George	instead	of	Pat	Benatar.
Since	you	started	kindergarten	at	age	four,	youâ€™ve	been	a	year	younger	than
your	classmates,	and	you	were	baby-faced	to	begin	with.	But	smearing	your	lids
with	four	different	eye	shadow	shades	and	wearing	dark	lipstick	doesnâ€™t	make
you	seem	olderâ€”it	makes	you	look	like	a	Madam	Alexander	doll	someone
marked	up	with	crayons.]]></text>

     <text><![CDATA[Hereâ€™s	the	deal:	You	mistakenly	believe	that	perfect	looks	will	translate	into	a
perfect,	problem-free	life.	Only	thereâ€™s	no	such	thing	as	a	perfect	face.	And
everyone	has	difficultiesâ€”always.	But	guess	what?	You	can	still	be	happy.
Poise	doesnâ€™t	come	out	of	a	bottle.	True	confidence	comes	from	succeeding	as
yourselfâ€”wilted	hair	and	all.	Soon	youâ€™ll	recognize	that	your	real	friends	love
you	no	matter	what	the	dayâ€™s	frizz	factor	may	be.	And	those	guys	you	like?
They	really	donâ€™t	care	about	your	hairstyle.	(Well,	there	is	that	one	guy	in
drama	class	who	loves	to	discuss	beauty	products	with	you.	Heâ€™s	cute,	yes,	but
trust	meâ€”heâ€™s	not	for	you.)
So	instead	of	trying	to	copy	celebrities,	justâ€¦be	you.	Put	away	the	styling	tools
and	twenty-five-color	eye	shadow	kit.	Make	peace	with	your	hair	and	let	your
real	face	show	(or	at	least	go	light	and	neutral	with	the	makeup).
Here	are	some	bonuses	to	taking	my	advice:
You	wonâ€™t	have	to	get	up	at	6:00	am	to	battle	your	hair	and	do	your	twelve-step
cosmetic	routine.
Youâ€™ll	save	money.
The	boys	will	appreciate	not	getting	Revlon	â€œCherries	in	the	Snowâ€	on	their
lips	when	they	kiss	you.	(And	they	will	kiss	you.)
Remember,	I	believe	in	you.	In	a	sense,	then,	you	already	do,	too.	So	act	like	it!
Jennifer	Ziegler	is	still	no	good	at	wearing	makeup,	still	has
bad	hair	days,	and	still	has	burn	marks	on	her	hand	from	high
school	curling	wands.	In	college	her	hairstylist	talked	her	into	a
â€œsubtle	red	rinseâ€	and	she	resembled	an	Irish	setter	for	months.
She	even	tried	the	all-black-wearing,	raccoon-eyed	lookâ€”only
to	find	that	sheâ€™s	too	giggly	to	be	goth.	She	now	channels	her
disillusionment	into	YA	novels	about	identity	and	acceptance,
including	the	titles	How	Not	to	Be	Popular	(2008)	and	Sass	&

Iâ€™ve	been	writing	the	acknowledgements	page	for	my	first	book	in	my	head	for
so	long	now	that	Iâ€™m	terrified	of	leaving	someone	out	in	the	real	thing.	Dear
Teen	Me	is	a	project	that	begins	and	ends	as	a	community	project.	We	couldnâ€™t
have	done	this	on	our	own.
First	I	want	to	thank	Miranda	Kenneally,	without	whom	this	whole	thing	would
have	been	just	a	pile	of	disorganized	emails	and	a	neon	Tumblr.	Seriously.	This
lady	is	so	talented	and	Iâ€™m	so	privileged	to	work	with	her.
And	then	I	want	to	thank	every	single	author	who	said	â€œyesâ€	when	I	sent	that
first	email.	Without	your	willingness	to	share	your	stories	on	the	Real	Live
Internets,	we	would	have	had	a	very	bright	but	also	very	empty	Tumblr	feed.
Of	course,	I	have	to	also	thank	the	authors	I	was	with	at	Spider	House	cafÃ©	in
Austin	when	I	sent	out	that	initial	email:	P.J.	Hoover,	Jessica	Lee	Anderson,
and	K.A.	Holt.	Thank	you	so	much	for	encouraging	me	(and	convincing	me	that
Dear	Teen	Me	wasnâ€™t	a	crazy	idea	in	the	first	place).	Youâ€™ve	got	my	back!
Thanks	also	to	all	of	the	other	writers	at	#THEPLACE	who	have	supported	me
throughout	this	project:	Madeline	Smoot,	Stephanie	Pellegrin,	Mari	Mancusi,
Cory	Putman	Oakes,	Jennifer	Ziegler,	and	Bethany	Hegedus.	Youâ€™re	amazing.
Thanks	to	Hallie	Warshaw,	who	found	me	in	the	exhibit	hall	at	ALA	and
thought	our	blog	sounded	like	it	would	be	a	great	book.	The	rest	of	Team	Zest,
too!	Not	to	mention	Sara	Megibow,	who	has	guided	us	so	thoughtfully
throughout	this	process.	Sara,	youâ€™re	a	gem!
And	where	would	I	be	without	my	home	team?	Nikhil,	my	heart,	my	number
one	supportâ€”thank	you	for	staying	up	late	with	me,	for	bringing	home	junk
food,	for	tolerating	the	paperback	takeover	of	our	home.	Thank	you	for
listening	to	me	read	aloud,	for	keeping	the	lights	on,	and	for	holding	my	hand.
Misha	and	Tim,	youâ€™re	the	best	friends	a	girl	could	ask	for.	And	Ali	and	Megan,
too!	Thank	you	all	for	being	as	excited	about	this	book	as	I	am,	and	for
pretending	to	be	interested	even	when	I	talk	about	the	boring	parts	of
publishing.	Emma,	Sarah,	Amber,	my	online	critique	partnersâ€”your	support
means	the	world	to	me,	no	matter	where	in	the	world	you	are!
Last	but	not	least,	my	family.	I	wouldnâ€™t	be	doing	what	I	love	today	without	the

first	thing	I	thought	when	I	saw	him	was	â€œpoor	guy.â€	The	doctor	told	me	I
might	not	get	a	single	room.	Damn	it.	I	started	crying.	In	the	end	though,	I	got
my	own	room,	but	it	was	small	and	run-down.	How	would	I	manage	to	stay
there	for	so	long?	I	wondered.	We	asked	the	doctor	if	I	could	be	placed	in	the
children's	unit.	At	first,	he	said	no,	but	we	kept	at	it,	and	the	third	time	he	said
he'd	try	to	arrange	it.	It	worked.	Third	time's	a	charm.
After	a	while	I	was	moved	to	the	children's	unit.	They	told	us	the	cutoff	age
was	eighteen.	So	then	why	the	hell	was	I	put	in	the	adult	unit	in	the	first	place?
I	get	irritated	just	thinking	about	it.	I'm	glad	I'm	not	eighteen.
The	children's	unit	was	much	betterâ€”renovated	and	a	lot	larger.	The	rooms
were	big	and	had	flatscreen	TVs.	There	was	even	space	for	my	family.	My
mood	got	way	better,	even	though	I	still	felt	really	sick.
On	Friday,	August	29,	Regine's	mother,	Julianne,	wrote	in	her	diary:
We're	now	at	Day	5	in	the	Trondheim	hospital,	and	it's	been	exactly	one	week
since	we	found	out	that	Regine	had	acute	leukemia.	Who	could	have	possibly
seen	this	coming?	In	the	blink	of	an	eye	we	went	from	being	blissfully	unaware
to	being	devastated	by	desperation,	pain,	and	a	sense	of	injustice.	Why	would
this	happen	to	our	dearest	possessionâ€”our	lovely,	intelligent	daughter,	who's
never	hurt	anyone?	Everything	I've	ever	seen	from	her	shows	that	she's	a	good

     <text><![CDATA[Autumn,	2008
On	being	diagnosed	with	a	serious	disease
Tuesday,	November	4,	2008
Disclaimer:	I've	decided	to	start	a	blog	about	what	it's	like	to	get	a	life-
threatening	disease.	Some	of	the	content	will	therefore	be	too	heavy	for	some
people.
The	whole	thing	started	on	Friday,	August	22
Ihad	just	come	home	from	school	and	didn't	have	a	care	in	the	world.	Then
Mom	walked	in,	and	right	away	I	realized	something	was	wrong.	She	had
tears	in	her	eyes.	The	doctor	had	called,	and	they	suspected	leukemia.	I	had	to
go	to	the	hospital	as	soon	as	possible	for	a	bone	marrow	biopsy.1
Right	away	I	felt	like	my	life	had	been	shattered.	I	was	crying	my	eyes	out.	I
had	a	million	conflicting	emotions,	but	more	than	anything	else,	I	was	scared.
At	the	hospital	in	Kristiansund	they	started	right	out	with	the	tests.	The
biopsy	wasn't	pleasant	at	allâ€”I	was	shocked	at	how	painful	it	was.	And	then	I
had	to	wait	three	hours	for	the	results.	I	sat	around	at	the	hospital	with	Mom
and	Dad	until	the	doctor	came	in.	We	were	nervous	and	scared.	He	had	tears	in
his	eyes:	I	had	leukemia,	more	specifically	AML	(acute	myelogenous
leukemia2).	I	could	feel	the	fear	spreading	all	through	my	body	when	he	said
that.	Cancer.	The	whole	family	was	crushed.	I	couldn't	stop	asking	myself:	Is
this	a	death	sentence?
On	Monday,	August	25,	we	drove	to	Trondheim.	That's	where	I	had	to	go	for
treatment.
I	was	referred	to	the	adult	unit,	where	I	had	to	take	another	bone	marrow
biopsy.	This	time	it	was	going	to	be	even	more	extensive	than	what	they'd	done
before.	In	this	kind	of	a	biopsy,	they	have	to	drill	out	a	bit	of	bone,	and	it's

SMILE!Amy	Kathleen	RyanDear	Teen	Me,I	know	you	hate	to	be	told	what	to	do	with	your	face.	Elderly	men	in	particularlove	telling	you	to	smileâ€”for	which	you	reward	them	with	a	sarcastic	smirk.Good	work.	They	should	mind	their	own	business.	But	since	Iâ€™m	you,	and	yourface	is	mine,	I	have	every	right	to	make	this	suggestion:	Slap	a	grin	on	yourmug.You	know	how	you	never	get	asked	out	on	dates?	Thatâ€™s	because	you	lurchthrough	the	hallways	of	your	school	with	your	head	down	as	if	you	wereducking	enemy	fire.I	canâ€™t	blame	you.	High	school	isnâ€™t	easy.	Youâ€™ve	got	all	typesâ€”frommotorheads	to	eggheads	to	potheadsâ€”crammed	into	a	single	building	at	highdensity,	and	you	have	to	get	through	the	day	without	erupting	into	civil	war.	Ihave	news	for	you,	too:	Adults	wouldnâ€™t	be	able	to	do	it.	In	adulthood,	peoplehave	self-sorted	into	pockets	of	like-minded	compadres.	The	computer	geekswork	together	at	Microsoft,	the	debate	members	have	all	joined	law	firms,	andthe	drama	kids	are	launching	off-off-Broadway	plays	in	Minneapolis.	So	donâ€™tlisten	to	adults	telling	you	these	are	the	best	years	of	your	life.	It	gets	infinitelybetter	when	you	can	choose	what	you	do,	where,	and	with	whom.	But	until	thatday	comes,	smile!Iâ€™m	not	saying	you	should	be	one	of	those	plastic,	ever-chipper	girls	whobounce	through	the	hallway	swinging	their	ponytails	behind	them	likebullwhips.	These	girls	will	grow	up	to	be	real	estate	agents,	politicians,	andPTA	presidents.	Their	smiles	will	become	like	debit	cards,	earning	themprofessional	capital,	but	depleting	them	in	the	soul	department.Nonetheless,	there	are	occasions	when	it	would	be	eminently	appropriate	foryou	to	smile.	For	instance,	you	know	that	cute	guy	in	the	leather	jacket	whowas	ogling	you	at	the	football	game?	And	you	know	how	you	were	so	nervousyou	could	barely	glance	in	his	direction?	When	you	did	look	at	him,	it	was	ohso	casually,	as	though	your	eye	was	actually	drawn	to	the	overboiled	hotdogs

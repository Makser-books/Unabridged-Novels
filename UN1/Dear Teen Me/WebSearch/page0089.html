2.	One	of	the	lasting	effects	of	this	horrible	experience	is	a	virus	that	winds	upgiving	you	seizures.	3.	Do	not	give	up.Seriously.	Thatâ€™s	the	point.	DO	NOT	GIVE	UP.	Youâ€™re	going	to	have	seizures.You	are	actually	going	to	develop	a	rash	as	a	result	of	those	seizures.	The	rashis	pretty	gross.	Pack	a	lot	of	tights	and	pants	to	hide	it.	The	seizures	will	startwith	your	hand	jerking.	Then	youâ€™ll	pass	out.At	one	point	youâ€™ll	pass	out	when	youâ€™re	near	a	cute	boy	in	your	philosophyclass.	Heâ€™ll	try	not	to	panic,	but	heâ€™ll	also	kind	of	fail.	At	another	point	youâ€™llpass	out	in	your	dorm	room.	And	once,	you	even	wind	up	falling	off	a	ladder	atyour	Othello	rehearsal.	Sometimes	youâ€™ll	hit	your	head.	Sometimes	youâ€™ll	windup	with	so	many	bruises	that	people	will	think	youâ€™re	being	abused.Sometimes	people	will	say,	â€œHey,	arenâ€™t	you	the	girl	who	hasâ€¦â€Theyâ€™ll	search	for	an	inoffensive	word.	Theyâ€™ll	usually	find	it.	And	you,	foryour	part,	will	usually	just	be	honest	and	answer	yes.	And	a	lot	of	thoseawesome	people	at	Bates	College	wonâ€™t	care	at	all.	Theyâ€™ll	still	love	youdespite	the	fact	that	youâ€™ve	lost	IQ	points	from	all	the	seizures.Yes,	Carrie,	there	will	be	cognitive	degeneration.	Yes,	Carrie,	that	means	youwonâ€™t	be	able	to	recall	recent	conversations	that	well	anymore,	or	class	lectures,and	youâ€™ll	actually	have	to	study.Hereâ€™s	the	thing:	Your	sickness	isnâ€™t	important.	Itâ€™s	not	going	to	define	whoyou	are.	You	have	to	be	the	one	to	do	that.Your	first	seizure	will	happen	at	home.	You	and	Joe	are	hanging	on	the	floor,watching	Amazon	Women	on	the	Moonâ€”this	spoof	movie	that	makes	fun	ofother	movies	and	shows.	Itâ€™s	sort	of	a	bunch	of	weird	skits	that	feature	thingslike	a	hero	guy	fighting	against	giant	spiders,	and	a	first	lady	who	used	to	be	ahooker.	Stuff	like	that.You	arenâ€™t	feeling	great.	You	think	itâ€™s	the	stress.	A	half-eaten	tray	of	nachosrests	on	the	heavy	wooden	coffee	table	in	front	of	you.	About	four	cans	of	Pepsilinger	around	the	nachos,	flip	tops	open,	and	almost	drained.

Then	the	coolest	thing	happens:	a	big,	tall,	muscular	guy	starts	taking	classes	atyour	studio.	Heâ€™s	a	dance	major	in	college	and	even	though	heâ€™s	a	moderndancer	(not	a	ballet	dancer,	which	you	think	is	clearly	superior),	you	two	hookup.	Yeah,	heâ€™s	a	little	older.	But	he	gives	you	books	to	read	and	music	to	listento	and	your	stepmother	is	about	to	lose	her	mind	because	heâ€™s	the	closest	thingaround	to	Mick	Jagger.	That	is	to	say,	heâ€™s	got	a	real	edge.	He	tells	you	aboutthis	â€œprojectâ€	he	did	where	he	danced	around	for	a	while	wearing	a	raincoat,then	climbed	into	a	barrel	while	another	dancer	poured	gallons	of	milk	over	hishead	and	then	added	several	boxes	of	cornflakes.	You	think	this	is	a	little	bitrandom	(okay,	a	lot),	but	the	fact	that	he	could	even	come	up	with	somethinglike	this	and,	moreover,	get	the	school	to	let	him	do	it	sends	you	soaring.Plus,	he	partners	you	in	classical	ballet	at	the	studio.	Youâ€™ve	never	gotten	todance	with	a	guy	before,	and	it	turns	out	that	you	totally	light	up	the	room	whenyou	leap	into	his	arms	and	do	a	fish	dive	(sorry,	thatâ€™s	the	technical	term)	andthen,	after	class,	you	two	drive	to	Balboa	Park	and	make	out	in	the	OrganPavilion.	(The	unfortunate	double	entendre	doesnâ€™t	register	at	the	time.)	Andyour	ballet	teacher	(Russian,	strict,	and,	apparently,	very	romantic)	tells	youthat	you	should	marry	this	boy.Which	would	be	another	way	of	dropping	out	of	high	school;	but	your	man-dancer	is	not	asking	and,	in	fact,	he	leaves	after	a	while	because	heâ€™stransferring	to	a	new	college.So	now	youâ€™re	losing	the	Cornflake	King	of	the	dance	world,	the	only	personyouâ€™ve	ever	told	about	your	attempt	to	conjure	the	Jaggerverse	into	reality	withsmokinâ€™	choreography.	And	your	heart	aches	when	he	makes	his	dramatic	exitlike	someone	in	The	Black	Swan.	Youâ€™ve	always	known	in	the	back	of	yourmind	that	heâ€™s	older	and	that	because	youâ€™re	so	angsty	and	conflicted,	you	feellike	you	canâ€™t	hold	your	own	against	a	mature	dancer	like	him.	(Even	if	he	isjust	a	modern	dancer.)So	here	you	are	in	the	picture,	your	blood	practically	curdling	with	anxiety,	andwhatever	I	say	to	you	right	now	will	probably	sound	like	a	lecture.	Except	this:dance	your	dang	fool	heart	out,	girl.	Because	as	of	this	writing,	Mick	Jagger	isstill	alive,	and	so	are	you.	Beautiful	music	makes	you	cry,	and	you	know	somegreat	people	who	totally	get	that.	And	between	this	pictureâ€™s	now	and	the	nowof	the	future,	youâ€™re	going	to	conjure	a	lot	of	cool	universes.And,	just	for	the	record,	I	listened	to	â€œLady	Janeâ€	thirty-two	times	in	a	rowwhile	writing	you	this	letter.	And	it	was	amazing.

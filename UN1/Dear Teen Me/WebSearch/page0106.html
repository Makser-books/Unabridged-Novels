HOPE	UNTIL	THE	LAST	SECONDMary	LindseyDear	Teen	Me,The	adults	around	you	love	to	say,	â€œLifeâ€™s	not	fairâ€â€”which	is	totallyunnecessary.	Youâ€™re	slapped	in	the	face	with	that	fact	every	time	you	stepthrough	the	door	to	your	house.	Just	like	you,	the	house	seems	cheerful	andcomposed	from	the	outside,	but	inside,	itâ€™s	a	disaster.You	use	the	trick	you	learned	in	acting	class:	Work	from	the	inside	out,	and	ifthat	doesnâ€™t	achieve	the	desired	effect,	cloak	from	the	outside	in.I	remember	that	last	day	of	summer	before	your	freshman	year	of	high	school.You	made	a	pact	with	yourself.	You	closed	the	door	to	the	laundry	room	(it	wasthe	only	way	to	get	away	from	them),	and	you	vowed	to	never	give	in	toaddiction.	You	would	not	give	up	on	yourself	or	on	your	future.	You	wouldnever	be	like	them,	and	you	would	never	allow	anyone	to	make	you	feel	badabout	yourself.	Most	of	all,	youâ€™d	never	let	anyone	in	on	your	private	lifeoutside	of	school.	Success	is	based	on	appearances,	and	you	would	appear	to	benormal.On	one	hand,	this	was	a	fantastic	strategy.	At	sixteen,	youâ€™d	realized	that	self-worth	and	outer	impressions	are	keys	to	success.	You	have	loads	of	friends(however	superficial	they	may	be)	and	will	even	be	elected	cheerleaderâ€”thepinnacle	of	high	school	success,	right?On	the	other	hand,	your	strategy	is	unhealthy.	Youâ€™re	lucky	this	plan	worked,because	holding	things	in	is	not	only	stressful,	but	it	can	be	physically	andpsychologically	dangerous.Next	year,	when	youâ€™re	seventeen,	youâ€™ll	find	someone	with	whom	you	canshare	your	pain	and	struggle.	Someone	who	will	understand	what	youâ€™re	goingthrough	and	who	wonâ€™t	judge	you,	gossip	about	you,	or	lord	your	secrets	overyou.	Someone	who	will	tell	you	that	you	can	rise	above	it.	Someone	whobelieves	in	you	unconditionally,	and	who	will	hold	a	place	in	your	heart	for	therest	of	your	life.

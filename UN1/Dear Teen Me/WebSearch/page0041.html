THE	PRINCIPALâ€™S	OFFICEJessica	CorraDear	Teen	Me,She	may	have	saved	your	life.Big	Bernâ€”excuse	me,	Sister	Bernard	Agnesâ€”isnâ€™t	the	chatty	type.	Rememberwhen	she	yelled	at	the	entire	football	team?	Seriously,	sheâ€™s	not	to	be	messedwith.	The	vice	principal	may	be	the	school	disciplinarian,	but	Big	Bern	is	theone	to	fear.Sheâ€™s	tall	and	broad	and	imposing	and	no	one	wants	to	get	called	to	her	office.You	never	thought	you	had	any	reason	to	worry,	really,	but	all	of	a	sudden	atthe	end	of	your	sophomore	year,	they	call	your	name	on	the	loudspeaker.	Andyou	have	no	idea	why.	You	tremble	a	little	as	you	sit	down.	Youâ€™ve	talked	withthis	woman	before,	because	youâ€™re	a	goody-two-shoes	and	sheâ€™s	asked	you	tohelp	with	projects	from	time	to	time,	so	maybe	thatâ€™s	the	reason.	You	donâ€™tknow	of	anything	you	could	have	made	a	mess	of,	but	maybe	youâ€™ve	forgottensomething.She	lays	it	out	for	you:	She	heard	you	wanted	to	transfer	to	the	public	school,and	she	wants	to	ask	you	why.	Shifting	on	the	hard	plastic	chair	to	avoid	thefull	force	of	her	attention,	you	have	to	admit	that	youâ€™re	miserable	at	this	tinyprivate	school.	High	school	was	supposed	to	be	a	new	leaf,	but	it	never	turnedover.	Youâ€™ve	never	felt	like	you	fit	in,	and	you	sure	donâ€™t	have	any	friends.	Infact,	outside	of	your	time	spent	at	the	community	theater	with	the	public	schoolkids,	youâ€™re	pretty	depressed.	And	even	the	theater	isnâ€™t	going	so	well	rightnow.	Youâ€™re	horrified	to	say	this,	and	youâ€™re	not	even	sure	why	you	do.	Butyou	tell	her	the	truth.You	both	sit	in	silence	for	a	moment,	but	then	Big	Bern	simply	suggests	thatyou	go	to	the	school	library.	Thatâ€™s	all	she	says:	â€œTry	the	library.â€	She	isnâ€™tmotherly,	she	isnâ€™t	sympathetic,	but	she	is	awfully	insightful.	You	go	to	thelibrary.The	library	aides	are	bookworms	and	they	welcome	you	immediately.	You	findyour	tribe	there,	and	you	stay	put.	This	turns	out	to	be	a	good	thing,	since	youâ€™ll

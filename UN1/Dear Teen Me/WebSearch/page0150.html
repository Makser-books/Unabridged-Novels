HOLD	ON	TIGHTCheryl	RainfieldDear	Teen	Me,I	know	you	dream	of	escape,	of	being	rescued,	of	never	being	hurt	again.	Iknow	you	think	your	pain	will	never	end,	and	sometimes	you	donâ€™t	know	howto	go	on.	And	I	know	you	think	about	killing	yourself.	Youâ€™re	good	withblades,	and	you	know	that	you	could	do	it.	But	something	stops	you.	And	thatsomething	is	good:	Itâ€™s	hope.	Hope,	tenacity,	and	your	fighting	spirit.I	know	that	when	your	pain	feels	unbearable,	when	every	second	seems	liketorture,	you	cut	yourself	in	secret,	then	carefully	hide	the	evidence	beneath	longsleeves.	But	you	wish	someone	would	see	the	truth	and	ask	â€œwhy?â€	You	wishsomeone	could	see	past	your	parentsâ€™	facades,	their	â€œprotectiveness,â€	and	theirtight	smiles,	and	see	how	cruel	they	really	are.I	know	it	seems	like	it	will	never	endâ€”the	rape,	the	tortureâ€”and	so	you	push	itdown	as	hard	as	you	can	and	try	to	forget,	but	fragments	keep	slicing	into	yourmind.	Somehow,	youâ€™re	sure	that	remembering	is	the	only	way	to	get	safe.	Andyouâ€™re	right.	Remembering	and	telling	your	story	is	the	key	to	your	safety.You	will	escape.	Youâ€™ll	run	away	from	home,	and	when	they	find	you	again,youâ€™ll	have	to	endure	even	more	abuse.	But	youâ€™ll	keep	building	up	your	innerstrength	so	that	you	can	find	a	way	to	break	away	again	and	again	and	again.Each	and	every	time	that	you	cut	off	contact	with	your	abusers,	you	liberateyourself	a	little	bit	more,	until	you	are	finally	and	completely	free.Youâ€™ll	find	a	good	therapist,	one	who	gives	you	empathy,	compassion,	andlove.	She	will	be	a	lifeline	for	you,	and	youâ€™re	right	to	seek	her	support.	Itâ€™s	toohard	to	do	it	alone.	All	those	experiences	and	your	own	intuition	will	help	youfigure	out	exactly	who	you	can	trust.	Youâ€™ll	fight	your	abusersâ€™	attempts	tobreak	you	down	by	creating	your	own	counter	messages,	and	by	finding	otherpeople	who	will	appreciate	and	support	you.	Youâ€™ll	break	through	your	abusersâ€™mind	control,	lies,	and	threats,	and	youâ€™ll	find	your	voice	in	writing.	Youâ€™llwrite	books!	And	theyâ€™ll	reach	other	teens	who	need	them.	You	will	touchlives.

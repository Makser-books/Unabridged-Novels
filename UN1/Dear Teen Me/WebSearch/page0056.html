about	yourself	hidden.	You	kept	the	fact	that	you	were	gay	a	secret	for	a	verylong	time	and	it	stunted	your	emotional	growth.	You	had	no	idea	how	to	forman	honest,	adult	relationship,	because	you	couldnâ€™t	form	an	honest	relationshipwith	yourself.	And	you	didnâ€™t	know	how	to	act	with	other	guys	because	younever	took	chances.	I	donâ€™t	think	you	should	have	professed	your	undying	loveto	your	onstage	partner,	but	you	definitely	should	have	looked	yourself	in	themirror	and	been	honest.	You	should	have	told	yourself	that	these	feelings	youhad	were	real.	And	you	should	have	confided	in	your	parents,	or	talked	withRob	or	Donâ€”your	closest	friendsâ€”and	asked	them	to	share	some	of	the	burdenthat	you	were	carrying;	thatâ€™s	what	family	and	friends	are	there	for.	Youshouldnâ€™t	have	tried	to	do	it	on	your	own.So	Michael,	if	youâ€™re	listening,	donâ€™t	spend	time	living	your	life	in	a	vacuum.Reach	out	to	someone	you	can	trustâ€”a	parent,	a	teacher,	a	friendâ€”and	tellthem	whatâ€™s	going	on	inside	your	brain	and	your	heart.	Donâ€™t	worry	about	howtheyâ€™ll	react;	they	may	be	surprised,	and	they	may	not	understand,	but	at	leasttheyâ€™ll	know.Which	means	that	no	matter	what,	you	wonâ€™t	ever	be	alone	again.Michael	Griffo	performed	as	an	actor	throughout	the	country,off	Broadway,	and	as	far	away	as	Hong	Kong.	He	made	thetransition	to	playwright	in	2001	and	his	first	play,	No	MoreSundays,	won	the	New	Jersey	Perry	Award	for	Best	OriginalPlay.	His	first	novel,	Unnaturalâ€”the	first	in	a	new	young	adultvampire	seriesâ€”was	published	in	March	2011.	Unwelcome(2011)	and	Unafraid	(2012)	quickly	followed.	Next	up	isMoonglow,	featuring	a	sixteen-year-old	girl	who	falls	victim	to	afamily	curse.	Visit	MichaelGriffo.com.

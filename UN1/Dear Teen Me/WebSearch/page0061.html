Youâ€™ve	made	up	your	mind.Thatâ€™s	why	youâ€™re	here	in	the	middle	of	the	night.	Thatâ€™s	why	you	let	Drewâ€™sbest	friend,	Nate,	pick	you	up	after	you	snuck	out	of	bed,	crept	down	the	stairsto	the	kitchen,	and	out	the	garage	door.	Not	the	big	garage	door	with	itselectronic	switch,	but	the	side	door	that	opens	to	the	backyardâ€”to	where	yourfamilyâ€™s	golden	retrievers	sleep.	Both	Rainy	and	Snowy	bark	at	you,	and	at	thatpoint	you	almost	head	back	inside.	Almost.	Instead	you	run.	You	run	for	thecorner.When	Nate	picks	you	up,	you	donâ€™t	know	what	to	say.	Heâ€™s	your	friend.Youâ€™ve	known	him	for	the	two	years	youâ€™ve	been	dating	Drew	on	and	off.	Youdonâ€™t	go	to	the	same	high	school	anymore.	(Zoning.)	Nate	plays	saxophone	inthe	marching	band.	Drew	plays	trumpet.Nate	fiddles	with	the	car	radio	and	mentions	that	Drewâ€™s	car	is	in	the	shop.	Youmake	small	talk.	Uncomfortable	small	talk.	Your	best	friend,	Andrea,	datedNate	for	a	few	weeks.	They	broke	up	when	she	wouldnâ€™t	give	him	a	BJ.	Dadthinks	black	guys	are	only	after	one	thingâ€”sexâ€”but	you	know	thatâ€™s	not	true.You	and	Drew	have	been	dating	for	a	long	time.	You	make	out.	You	touch	oneanother.	But	youâ€™ve	never	gone	all	the	way.	He	hasnâ€™t	threatened	to	break	upwith	you	if	you	donâ€™t.Tonight	is	the	nightâ€”you	know	it.Youâ€™re	in	his	bedroom.	Drew	nuzzles	your	ear.	Youâ€™ve	been	kissing	for	whatfeels	like	hours.	The	bed	creaks	and	your	bodies	shift.	Your	journal	is	filledwith	poems	about	Drew.	About	how	Drew	feels	about	you.	About	how	hard	it	isto	date	a	black	guy.	To	deal	with	the	stares	of	people	in	the	mall.	Or	the	movies.Not	that	you	guys	go	out	very	often.	Neither	of	you	likes	the	stares.Your	friend	Alicia	lives	in	the	same	neighborhood	as	Drew.	Her	dad	is	acolonel	in	the	army.	Drewâ€™s	dad	is	in	the	army,	too,	but	you	havenâ€™t	ever	met

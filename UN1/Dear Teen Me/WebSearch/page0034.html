THANK	YOU,	OILY	PIZZAJosh	A.	CaganDear	Teen	Me,The	cafeteria	pizza	at	BU	is	disgusting,	but	you	and	the	kids	youâ€™re	hanging	outwith	eat	it	because	itâ€™s	Friday	night	and	hey,	youâ€™re	freshmen.	Youâ€™re	wearing	aplastic	Dick	Tracy	movie-tie-in	hat.	(Youâ€™re	trying	to	make	that	your	â€œthing.â€)Iâ€™m	sure	youâ€™ve	noticed	that	I	said	â€œthe	kids	youâ€™re	hanging	out	with,â€	and	notâ€œyour	friends.â€	Your	friends	are	a	distant,	candy-coated	memory.Why	youâ€™re	even	hanging	out	with	these	kids	is	a	mystery,	because	as	far	asyouâ€™re	concerned,	nobody	likes	you.	Youâ€™re	not	doing	great	in	class,	andnobody	else	wants	to	talk	about	cartoons	and	Muppetsâ€”instead,	they	want	totalk	about	Shakespeare	and	Chekhov.	Everyone	else	came	from	fascinatingplaces,	theyâ€™ve	had	amazing	lives,	and	they	seem	like	they	were	born	into	a	lifein	the	theater.Youâ€™re	some	boring	guy	from	a	boring	suburb.So	for	the	first	part	of	your	freshman	year,	you	try	to	communicate	to	everyoneat	all	times	that	YOU	ARE	DIFFERENT	AND	SPECIAL.	If	you	could	wear	agold	dookie	chain	around	your	neck	that	said	that,	you	would.	(Although	youprobably	would	have	spray-painted	it	black	first.	You	wear	a	lot	of	black,hoping	you	can	make	that	your	â€œthing.â€)You	wear	a	different	pair	of	crazy	sunglasses	every	day	of	the	week,	hopingyou	can	make	that	your	â€œthing.â€You	never	work	with	other	students	unless	itâ€™s	absolutely	demanded	of	you,and	instead	you	present	bombastic	monologues	about	murder	and	loneliness,hoping	you	can	make	that	your	â€œthing.â€You	work	your	ass	off	to	prove	to	people	that	you	are	awesome,	smart,	edgy,and	talented.	You	work	harder	at	that	than	you	do	at	any	actual	schoolwork,harder	than	you	even	work	on	your	own	art.	Whether	you	know	it	or	not,	this	iswhat	has	actually	become	your	â€œthing.â€Still,	thank	God	you	live	in	a	dorm.	Because	regardless	of	your	social	status

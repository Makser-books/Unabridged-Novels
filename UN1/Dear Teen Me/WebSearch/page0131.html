Itâ€™s	not	hormones	and	itâ€™s	not	a	phase,	and	I	believe	you,	andyou	should	have	actually	talked	to	that	therapist	and	reached	out	and	gotten	thehelp	you	needed	a	long	time	ago,	because	youâ€™re	going	to	keep	doing	this	foryears,	and	it	just	does	not	have	to	be	this	hard.â€œSuffering	for	your	artâ€	is	just	a	pretty	phrase	people	say,	okay?But	youâ€™re	not	going	to	listen,	and	youâ€™re	going	to	keep	doing	this	to	yourselffor	a	long	time.Youâ€™ll	probably	be	surprised	at	what	fixes	itself	when	you	get	better.	Thingsthat	seem	irreparably	broken	now,	like	your	relationship	with	your	mom?	Youtwo	are	going	to	have	an	amazing	relationship.	Your	best	friend	whoâ€™s	doingeven	worse	than	you	are?	Sheâ€™s	okay	now,	too.Those	songs	you	listened	to	while	you	drove	to	therapy	and	out	for	coffee	withboys	or	around	your	neighborhood	and	thought	about	food	the	entire	way	everytime?	Those	songs	are	eating	disorder	songs	and	will	be	until	the	day	you	die.You	broke	those	songs.But	itâ€™s	okay.	Because	here	I	am,	as	better	as	it	really	gets,	listening	to	thosesongs	and	remembering	you.Whatâ€™s	funny	is	that	I	canâ€™t	write	a	good	story	thatâ€™s	in	any	way	related	to	youreating	disorder.	Iâ€™ve	tried,	believe	me,	because	everyoneâ€™s	always	telling	me	towrite	what	I	know,	but	the	truth	is,	your	ED	ruined	that	story	for	me,	becausenow	itâ€™s	full	of	details	that	arenâ€™t	important	and	donâ€™t	make	any	larger	sense,and	theyâ€™re	clogging	up	the	big	picture	and	Iâ€™m	so	filled	with	shame	when	I	tryto	type	that	I	canâ€™t	ever	make	it	sound	real.	You	took	that	story	off	the	table.	Itâ€™sthe	same	reason	that	when	you	wanted	to	write	a	book	with	self-injury,	you	hadto	have	the	kid	break	his	bones,	because	you	took	all	the	normal	stuff	off	thetable,	didnâ€™t	you?	You	stole	the	stories.	You	keep	stealing	stories.Stop.	Leave	me	something	to	work	with.	Donâ€™t	make	me	try	to	make	art	out	ofyour	suffering.	It	doesnâ€™t	work.Get	better.Get	better.Get	better.And	get	a	fucking	move	on,	because	I	have	all	these	books	to	write	and	youneed	to	not	use	up	any	more	stories	because	Iâ€™m	bad	enough	at	coming	up	with

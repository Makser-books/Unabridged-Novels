WHO	NEEDS	LUCK?Stacey	JayDear	Teen	Me,In	the	past	few	years,	youâ€™ve	dated	more	than	your	fair	share	of	creeps,	andattended	more	than	your	fair	share	of	funerals,	and	the	road	will	only	getbumpier	from	here	on	out.	You	are	the	opposite	of	lucky,	my	girl,	so	itâ€™s	a	goodthing	you	have	friends.	Without	them,	you	might	not	be	around	to	write	thisletter.Youâ€™re	seventeen	and	youâ€™re	doing	a	LOT	of	dumb,	dangerous	things.	Asidefrom	drinking	and	drugging	and	driving	your	girlfriends	to	parties	where	youstep	over	toothless	addicts	to	get	to	the	door,	you	have	your	own	secret	brand	ofcrazy.	You	climb	out	on	the	roof	and	walk	the	ridge	at	night,	letting	your	toesdangle	off	the	edge.	You	have	a	stash	of	twenty-dollar	bills	under	the	ashtray	inyour	car,	and	sometimes	you	get	a	few	hundred	miles	into	running	away	beforeyou	come	back.Sometimes	you	want	to	talk	to	an	adult	about	how	alienated	and	confused	youfeel,	but	youâ€™re	afraid	your	parents	and	teachers	and	church	leaders	will	hateyou.	You	have	a	wonderful	family,	a	solid	community,	and	people	who	supportyour	artsy-fartsy	tendencies	and	think	youâ€™ve	got	potential,	kid.	You	donâ€™t	thinkyou	deserve	to	be	so	miserable.But	misery	isnâ€™t	something	you	have	to	earn.	Misery	is	misery.	It	just	is.	I	knowwhatâ€™s	going	on	inside	of	you,	andâ€¦I	wish	I	could	say	that	youâ€™re	not	seeingthings	clearly,	and	that	the	world	will	be	shiny	and	wonderful	when	youâ€™regrown	up,	but	I	canâ€™t,	because	it	wonâ€™t.I	can,	however,	offer	hope.In	a	few	years,	with	the	help	of	a	liberal	college	staffed	by	amazing	teachers,youâ€™re	going	to	realize	itâ€™s	your	society	thatâ€™s	sick	and	twisted,	not	you.	Youâ€™regoing	to	break	free	of	the	conditioning	of	your	conservative,	Southern	Baptistchildhood	and	declare	yourself	a	feminist,	an	atheist	(later	an	agnostic),	and	anindependent.	Youâ€™re	going	to	stop	starving	yourself	to	be	â€œpretty;â€	youâ€™re	goingto	teach	yoga	and	volunteer	and	realize	that	parts	of	your	spiritual	upbringing

hopscotch,	all	skinny-legged	and	gangly,	on	the	sidewalk	outside	School	Two.You	drive	her	home.	The	light	outside	the	old	farmhouse	reveals	the	fact	thather	motherâ€™s	been	waiting	up	for	her.	You	walk	her	to	her	door,	and	she	kissesyour	cheek	and	whispers,	â€œThank	you,â€	before	she	goes	in.	Itâ€™s	your	first	kissâ€”although	you	wonâ€™t	realize	that	or	even	value	what	it	means	until	a	lot	later.What	I	like	about	you	in	that	memory	is	not	just	what	you	did,	but	the	way	youdid	it.	You	didnâ€™t	think	of	yourself	as	a	hero.	You	didnâ€™t	do	it	to	proveanything.	In	fact,	for	many	years	afterward	you	wonder	what	was	really	goingon	in	your	head	back	then:	Did	you	have	the	urge	to	climb	in	that	car	withLouise	yourself?	(You	didnâ€™t.)	Did	you	do	the	right	thing?	(You	did.)If	you	had	to	define	what	you	were	feeling	at	that	moment,	it	was	probablysadness,	more	than	anything	else.	Until	this	letter	youâ€™ve	never	mentioned	whathappened	that	night	to	anyoneâ€”not	to	the	guys	who	avoided	you	as	you	walkeddown	the	hall	on	Monday	morning,	not	to	Linda	S.,	not	even	to	yourgrandmother	(even	though	you	know	sheâ€™d	have	been	proud	of	the	way	youfollowed	the	path	she	put	you	on).	But	you	didnâ€™t	do	it	for	her	approval.	Youdid	it	for	the	person	you	wanted	to	become.Joseph	Bruchac	lives	in	the	same	house	in	the	Adirondackfoothills	town	of	Greenfield	Center,	New	York,	where	he	wasraised	by	his	grandparents.	Heâ€™s	the	author	of	more	than	120books,	ranging	from	picture	books	to	plays,	nonfiction,	poetry,and	novels	for	middle	school,	high	school,	and	adult	readers.His	writing	often	reflects	his	Abenaki	Indian	heritage.	That	iseven	true	of	his	new	YA	novel	Wolf	Mark	(2011),	a	paranormalthriller	with	an	American	Indian	take	on	shape-shifting.

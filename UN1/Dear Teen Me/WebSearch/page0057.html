THE	SKINNY	GIRLJanet	GurtlerDear	Teen	Me,Itâ€™s	kind	of	a	rush	isnâ€™t	itâ€”how	thin	youâ€™ve	become?	It	started	with	that	boyyouâ€™d	been	crushing	on.	Your	best	friend	asked	him	what	he	thought	of	you,and	in	response	he	reversed	the	words	from	the	punk	rock	song	by	the	Monksyou	all	loved	so	much:	Instead	of	â€œNice	legs.	Shame	about	her	face,â€	he	sang,â€œNice	face.	Shame	about	her	legs.â€Wow!	That	comment	hurt	so	much	you	couldnâ€™t	breathe	for	a	minute,	and	ashamed	blush	stained	your	cheeks.	You	hated	being	the	chubby	one	in	a	familyfull	of	thin	kids,	and	suspected	that	your	size	made	you	inadequate	in	someway.	Teasing	sucked,	but	this	was	different.	This	was	from	a	boy	you	liked.And	it	was	devastating	to	your	already	fragile	ego.	So	a	diet	followed	and	theweight	dropped	off.And	for	the	first	time	now	youâ€™re	actually	skinny.	What	a	trip!	You	feelpowerful,	and	really	in	control.	I	can	see	why	itâ€™s	hard	to	say	no	to	the	attentionâ€”the	positive	attentionâ€”that	the	weight	loss	gets	you.	You	start	hanging	outwith	the	popular	girls	again,	as	if	thinness	makes	you	worthy,	but	inside	youfeel	empty.	Physically	and	emotionally.	They	love	how	skinny	youâ€™ve	become,though,	all	those	thin	girls.	When	one	of	them	brags	about	fitting	into	a	pair	ofyour	jeans	you	feel	like	youâ€™ve	made	it.	Like	your	thinness	is	something	to	bedesired.Unfortunately,	taking	it	off	isnâ€™t	the	hard	part.	Starving	yourself	is	sustainablefor	a	while,	but	itâ€™s	hard	to	keep	up.	Youâ€™re	basing	your	worth	on	how	manycalories	you	consume.	And	so	now,	when	you	do	eat,	itâ€™s	pure	guilt.	Whichleads	to	binges,	and	more	guilt.	And	then	youâ€™re	starving	yourself	again.	Youâ€™recaught	up	in	a	vicious	cycle.But	then	another	skinny	girl	at	school	shares	a	secret	with	you:	throwing	up.You	try	it,	but	youâ€™re	not	very	good	at	it.	That	makes	you	feel	like	even	more	ofa	failure,	and	the	weight	piles	back	on	again,	but	Iâ€™m	so	happy	now	that	youcouldnâ€™t	make	yourself	do	it.	Itâ€™s	a	dangerous,	dangerous	way	to	live,	and	some

LOSING	YOUR	SIGHT	SHOULDNâ€™T	MEANLOSING	YOUR	RIGHTSLaura	EllenDear	Teen	Me,Thereâ€™s	no	easy	way	to	say	this,	so	Iâ€™ll	just	be	blunt.	The	way	you	seeâ€”youknow,	with	that	sunspot-like-thing	that	blocks	your	central	vision?	Thatâ€™s	notnormal.	In	a	few	days	youâ€™re	going	to	go	to	the	eye	doctor	and	heâ€™s	going	to	tellyou	that	you	have	an	eye	disease	called	macular	degeneration.Okay,	stop	freaking	out.	It	doesnâ€™t	mean	youâ€™re	dying.	But	it	does	mean	thatyou	have	a	label	now,	â€œvisually	impaired,â€	which	will	affect	how	others	see	youâ€”and,	unfortunately,	how	you	see	yourself.I	wonâ€™t	lie.	Life	is	about	to	get	really	hard.	At	times	it	will	downright	suck,especially	when	you	discover	there	are	things	others	take	for	granted	that	youjust	canâ€™t	do.	Like	drive,	or	read	regular	print,	or	see	faces	unless	youâ€™re	reallyclose	up	(and	even	then	youâ€™ll	have	to	look	at	their	ears	to	see	their	eyes).Weird,	I	know.But	seriously,	who	cares?	Most	of	the	people	in	New	York	donâ€™t	drive,	andthere	are	audio	books	and	magnifying	glasses	and	ways	to	make	print	reallybigâ€¦.	It	never	gets	easy	staring	at	ears,	and	thereâ€™s	no	surefire	way	to	deal	withthe	jerks	who	embarrass	you	by	looking	all	around	before	asking,	â€œAre	youtalking	to	me?â€	And	yes,	all	of	that	stuff	will	make	you	feel	flawed	andâ€œabnormal.â€	But	normal	is	boring.	Itâ€™s	predictable	and	monotonous.â€œDifferent,â€	though,	different	is	cool	and	intriguing	and	way	more	fun.Some	of	your	teachers	will	try	to	pretend	you	see	like	everyone	else,	howeverâ€”because	being	different	means	more	work	for	them.	They	donâ€™t	want	to	typetheir	tests,	because	theyâ€™re	used	to	handwriting	them	at	the	last	minute,	and	theydonâ€™t	want	to	print	their	lecture	notes	in	advance,	because	they	actually	donâ€™thave	any	notes;	they	usually	just	wing	it.But	try	to	understand:	Their	refusal	to	help	has	nothing	to	do	with	you.	Theyâ€™retired	and	overworked	and	set	in	their	ways.	Theyâ€™ve	lost	sight	of	the	fact	that

living.I	get	it,	you	know?	You	donâ€™t	see	any	other	solution.	But	there	is	another	wayâ€”although	itâ€™s	a	hard	one.	You	can	hang	in	there,	deal	with	the	loneliness	andfeelings	of	worthlessness	as	best	you	can,	and	wait	it	out.	You	want	to	getthrough	this,	my	friend.	I	know	it	feels	like	things	will	never	change,	but	theywill	(although	in	all	honestly	itâ€™s	going	to	be	a	while	longer).Youâ€™ll	spend	a	long	string	of	years	coping	with	your	rage,	fleeing	the	black	holeof	depression,	and	struggling	to	make	yourself	whole	again.	Youâ€™ll	self-medicate.	You	wonâ€™t	date	very	many	people,	and	when	you	do,	your	decision-making	will	be,	um,	questionable.	And	every	time	you	see	another	humanbeing,	youâ€™ll	instinctively	turn	away,	because	nearly	every	person	on	the	planetlooks	like	a	slavering	monster-in-waiting.	But	eventually	youâ€™ll	discover	thatthe	seeds	of	compassion,	kindness,	and	generosity	are	still	within	you.	Itâ€™s	very,very	important	that	you	keep	those	seeds	alive,	because	later	in	life	youâ€™llfinally	learn	how	to	make	them	grow.Itâ€™s	not	a	given	that	those	seeds	of	kindness	will	sprout,	you	knowâ€”in	fact,thereâ€™ll	be	times	when	youâ€™ll	act	in	the	same	brutish,	inexcusable	manner	asyour	tormenters.	Thereâ€™ll	be	an	incident	later	in	your	junior	year	involving	aguy	in	your	class	who	deals	with	some	of	the	same	treatment	you	do.	The	twoof	you	have	already	spent	a	lot	of	time	trying	to	humiliate	each	other,	which	isregrettable	on	so,	so	many	levels,	but	one	day	youâ€™ll	go	too	far.	Youâ€™ll	circulatea	questionnaire	asking	if	this	guy	is	the	worldâ€™s	biggestâ€¦letâ€™s	say	orifice.	Itâ€™llbe	a	senseless,	stupid	act	of	cruelty,	and	while	you	might	not	deserve	to	bethrown	headfirst	into	a	wall	(which	is	whatâ€™ll	happenâ€”watch	your	head,	chief),it	wonâ€™t	be	hard	to	understand	the	intensity	of	his	reaction.	The	goose	egg	onyour	forehead	will	heal,	but	the	loose	thread	in	your	moral	fiber	is	probably	stillthere	to	this	day.Thankfully,	you	wonâ€™t	go	permanently	down	that	road.	Thatâ€™s	not	to	say	youlack	a	normal	range	of	moronic	tendencies,	or	that	youâ€™ll	never	hurt	anyoneever	again,	but	after	years	of	soul-searching	and	self-discovery	itâ€™ll	be	possibleto	describe	you	as	a	decent	guy.	I	know,	â€œdecent	guyâ€	lacks	the	high-schoolsizzle	of	things	like	â€œrock	star,â€	â€œbabe	magnet,â€	or	â€œparty	animal.â€	Youâ€™ll	nevermorph	into	any	of	those	things	(although	youâ€™ll	occasionally	humiliate	thebejesus	out	of	yourself	in	trying).	Itâ€™s	easy	to	underestimate	the	value	of	being	adecent	guy,	but	itâ€™s	what	saves	you	in	the	end.Iâ€™m	not	saying	your	future	â€œoh	hooray,	Iâ€™m	a	decent	guyâ€	self-assessment	will

Itâ€™s	onlybecause	of	Shad	that	your	heart	doesnâ€™t	wither	and	die.	Youâ€™ll	love	Shad,	andheâ€™ll	love	you,	no	matter	what.Listen:	As	soon	as	your	brothers	are	old	enough	to	look	after	themselves,	youneed	to	get	out	of	there.	Things	are	different	for	girls	in	your	family.	Run.Wherever	you	wind	up	going,	it	will	be	good	to	have	Shad	with	you.And	when	you	eventually	meet	your	motherâ€”try	to	understand	that	she	is	asbroken	as	your	dad.

No	matter	where	you	start,	and	no	matter	whereyou	are	today,	you	can	dream	a	new	tomorrow.

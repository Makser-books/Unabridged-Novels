FIRST	KISSâ€¦ISHJoseph	BruchacDear	Teen	Me,You	didnâ€™t	believe	that	what	your	grandmother	kept	telling	you	would	evercome	true.	You	couldnâ€™t.	But	when	you	hit	your	growth	spurt	you	really	hit	it.Suddenly,	you	were	bigger	and	stronger	than	all	of	the	guys	who	used	to	bullyyou.	Youâ€™d	been	fired	after	your	first	day	as	a	caddy	because	you	couldnâ€™t	lug	agolf	bag,	but	now	youâ€™re	the	right	tackle	on	the	football	team,	and	a	varsityheavyweight	wrestler.However,	Iâ€™m	sad	to	say	that	despite	the	growth	spurt	that	transformed	youfrom	a	bullied	brainiac	into	a	major	jock,	youâ€™re	still	not	about	to	get	the	girlanytime	soon.	Partly,	yes,	because	you	lack	smoothitude,	but	also	becauseyouâ€™re	not	willing	to	settle	for	just	anybody.	Your	grandmother	taught	you	torespect	women	as	actual	human	beings	(and	not	to	look	at	them	as	objects),	andyou	learned	that	lesson	well.	Your	grandmother	was	one	of	the	first	women	topass	the	bar	in	New	York,	and	even	though	she	never	worked	as	an	attorney,she	definitely	knew	how	to	â€œlay	down	the	lawâ€	on	your	behavior.In	the	eternal	meantime,	youâ€™re	on	your	own,	and	you	are	not	getting	it	on.Itâ€™s	senior	year	after	a	big	game.	Youâ€™re	eating	pizza	at	DeGregoryâ€™s	Restaurantwith	your	football	buddies.	Someone	comes	in	and	says	in	an	excited	whisper:â€œLinda	S.	is	in	a	car	out	back.	Sheâ€™s	drunk	and	willing	to	make	out	withanybody.â€Linda	S.	is	a	pretty	blonde	girl	two	years	younger	than	you,	a	shy	country	kidwho	lives	only	a	mile	from	you.	You	donâ€™t	remember	getting	up	or	goingthrough	the	door,	but	the	next	thing	you	know	youâ€™re	in	the	alley	beside	thatcar.	You	push	past	two	other	guys,	grab	skinny	Sammy	Carson	by	his	belt	andtoss	him	to	the	side.	But	then,	instead	of	climbing	into	the	back	of	that	wide-seated	â€˜58	Buick,	you	take	Linda	S.	by	the	arm	and	lead	her,	her	on	unsteadylegs,	to	your	car.	Other	guys	step	aside	when	they	see	that	look	in	your	eye.Sheâ€™s	crying	now.	You	give	her	your	handkerchief.	As	she	leans	against	the	cardoor	you	remember	what	she	looked	like	five	years	ago	when	she	was	playing

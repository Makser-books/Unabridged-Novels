ALL	THE	WORLDâ€™S	A	STAGEGretchen	McNeilDear	Teen	Me,You	always	needed	the	spotlight.Not	wanted.	Not	coveted.	Needed.Positive	or	negative,	you	needed	the	attention.	You	were	the	loudest	kid	at	thepartyâ€”the	one	most	likely	to	accept	a	dare,	or	do	something	ridiculous	to	get	alaugh.	Itâ€™s	possible	you	hold	the	world	record	for	the	number	of	times	you	hadto	write	â€œI	will	raise	my	hand	before	speakingâ€	in	the	course	of	sixth	grade.And	the	same	thing	goes	for	the	number	of	trips	to	the	principalâ€™s	office(because	you	could	never	resist	making	that	last	witty	comeback).	Did	you	evenconsider	how	your	mother	would	feel	after	the	umpteenth	time	she	was	calledin	to	discuss	your	behavior?Your	mom	blames	herself,	but	you	both	know	itâ€™s	not	her	fault.	Your	need	forattention	is	so	deeply	rooted	in	your	personality,	so	tangled	up	in	yourcomplicated	emotional	relationship	with	your	absentee	father,	that	thereâ€™s	nogetting	beyond	it.	At	this	point,	youâ€™ve	spent	so	many	years	jumping	throughhoops	to	get	him	to	notice	you,	that	the	behavior	has	become	ingrained.You	got	straight	Aâ€™s	in	school.	Did	that	make	him	call?	You	were	the	star	of	thesoccer	team.	Did	that	help	him	remember	your	birthday?	You	sang	atgraduation.	Did	that	force	him	to	show	up?	No,	no,	no.Iâ€™ve	got	some	bad	news	for	you:	Heâ€™s	never	going	to	notice,	acknowledge,remember,	or	even	just	show	up.	Never.	But	that	doesnâ€™t	stop	you	from	trying.But	hereâ€™s	the	good	news:	Extroverted	attention-seekers	have	a	perfect	outlet	onthe	stage.Sure,	youâ€™ve	been	performing	since	you	were	a	kid,	but	not	in	such	a	seriousrole,	and	never	in	a	musicalâ€”with	a	curtain	call	all	your	own.	Backstage,youâ€™re	lined	up,	ready	to	take	your	solo	bow	in	the	spotlight.	As	you	run	outonstage,	youâ€™re	terrified,	convinced	that	youâ€™re	about	to	run	into	a	mass	ofstares,	and	a	few	polite	claps.	But	then	it	happensâ€”and	youâ€™ll	remember	that

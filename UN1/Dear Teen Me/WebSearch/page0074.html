LOIS	LOWRY	AND	THE	SPACE-TIMECONTINUUM	VS.	BOYSK.	A.	HoltDear	Teen	Me,Hi!	Itâ€™s	your	thirty-six-year-old	self.	What?!	I	know!	(Good	news:	You	finallyhave	boobs.	Bad	news:	Thatâ€™s	not	what	I	want	to	talk	to	you	about.)I	want	to	tear	your	attention	away	from	whatever	poem	youâ€™re	writing,	or	worldcrisis	youâ€™re	trying	to	solve,	and	I	want	to	address	something	moreâ€¦personal.Iâ€™m	going	to	show	you	a	list	and	see	if	you	can	figure	out	what	the	commoningredient	is:Writing.	Books.	Drinking	coffee.	Sleeping	all	day	on	Saturdays.	Studying	art.Trying	to	create	a	rip	in	the	space-time	continuum	by	figuring	out	the	meaningof	life.	Listening	to	loud	music.	Going	to	plays.	Making	lists.See	what	they	have	in	common?Yes.Thatâ€™s	right.Those	are	all	things	you	enjoy	more	than	dating.I	just	wanted	to	send	you	this	note	(although	the	technology	that	I	used	is	asecret,	trust	me:	It	wonâ€™t	do	any	harm	to	the	space-time	continuum)	to	let	youknow	that	this	is	100	percent	completely	okay.	Just	because	youâ€™re	a	teenagerdoesnâ€™t	mean	you	have	to	be	boy-crazy.	Your	best	friend	might	have	a	differentboyfriend	every	two	weeks	and	spend	every	spare	second	making	out	in	thehalls	at	school,	but	this	doesnâ€™t	mean	you	have	to	do	the	same	thing.	And	Iknow	it	seems	like	every	movie	you	see	has	a	girl	pining	for	a	boy,	but	thatdoesnâ€™t	mean	you	have	to,	too.	I	promise.Boys	can	be	great.	You	know	that.	Theyâ€™re	funny	and	smart	and	nice	to	talk	to.You	like	how	their	hands	look,	and	sometimes	you	wonder	what	it	would	belike	to	sniff	the	backs	of	their	necks.	HOWEVER,	this	doesnâ€™t	mean	you	needto	say	yes	to	any	guy	who	asks	to	be	your	boyfriend.	It	doesnâ€™t	mean	you	have

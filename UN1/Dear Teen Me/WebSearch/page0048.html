I	promise,	for	the	handful	of	rude	and	ignorantteachers	that	youâ€™ll	have	to	deal	with,	there	will	be	so	many	more	who	will	goabove	and	beyond	for	youâ€”like	the	school	nurse.	Sheâ€™ll	spend	hours	enlargingEmma	and	other	novels	for	you	on	the	school	copier	whenever	a	large-printversion	isnâ€™t	available.Like	I	said,	donâ€™t	let	those	other	people	stress	you	outâ€”but	donâ€™t	stand	for	theirignorance	either.	You	arenâ€™t	being	difficult.	Itâ€™s	your	right	to	ask	for	thoseaccommodations.	Donâ€™t	sit	red-faced	and	silent	when	that	history	teacher	handsyou	an	illegible,	handwritten	test	for	the	twentieth	time.	Donâ€™t	cower	in	thecorner	when	that	Spanish	teacher	writes	the	entire	exam	on	the	board	anddoesnâ€™t	let	you	get	out	of	your	seat	to	read	it.Stand	up	for	yourself.I	know,	as	shy	and	timid	as	you	are,	itâ€™s	hard	to	imagine	pushing	back,	but	do	it.If	you	donâ€™t,	no	one	else	will.	Those	teachers	are	banking	on	your	passivity,	sothat	they	can	continue	to	sit	and	be	passive	themselves.	Donâ€™t	let	them	get	awaywith	it.	What	those	teachers	are	doing,	or	not	doing,	is	wrong.	And	when	theyhumiliate	you	in	front	of	the	class	with	their	insensitive	remarks,	not	only	is	thatwrong,	thatâ€™s	bullying.	And	itâ€™s	not	okay.Soâ€¦Open	your	mouth.Say	something.Refuse	to	accept	it.Youâ€™re	not	a	second-class	citizen;	donâ€™t	let	them	treat	you	like	one.This	whole	thing	is	a	lot	to	hear,	and	Iâ€™m	sorry	if	itâ€™s	a	bit	overwhelming,	but	Ineed	to	tell	you	a	little	more.	As	your	eyes	get	worse	and	you	find	yourselfbattling	ignorant,	insensitive	individuals	on	a	daily	basis,	youâ€™re	going	tobecome	angry	and	frustrated,	and	very,	very	confused.	Everyone	suddenlytreats	you	differently,	but	you	donâ€™t	feel	any	different.	This	will	make	youwonder	if	they	see	someone	else	when	they	look	at	you.	Youâ€™ll	start	doubtingyourself,	hating	yourself,	and	yes,	youâ€™ll	even	contemplate	ending	your	life.Stop.

out	to	the	garage	yourself,	and	when	you	donâ€™t	find	anything	you	start	towonder	if	maybe	you	really	are	the	idiot	that	he	says	you	are.	â€œDad,	whereâ€™s	theknife?â€â€œThere	is	no	knife,â€	he	says.	His	face	shuts	down.	â€œYou	made	a	mistake.Thereâ€™s	nothing	out	there	at	all.â€***That	is	where	this	memory	ends,	like	a	film	thatâ€™s	been	snipped	before	the	thirdreel.	You	never	forget	the	knife,	though,	despite	the	fact	that	for	the	next	fortyyears	theyâ€™ll	continue	to	deny	it	ever	existed	in	the	first	place.	When	theyfinally	do	fess	upâ€”many	years	laterâ€”they	say:	Oh,	we	didnâ€™t	think	you	neededto	know	about	that.Some	stories	donâ€™t	end	as	conclusively	as	weâ€™d	like	them	to,	I	guess.	But	nowyouâ€™re	a	shrink.	You	understand	how	much	your	dadâ€™s	survival	has	cost	him,and	you	understand	the	necessity	of	the	fictions	that	both	of	your	parents	stillhave	to	tell	themselves	in	order	to	keep	on	living.Today,	what	you	wish	you	could	tell	that	poor	twelve-year-old	kidâ€”the	onewho	spent	so	many	years	hurting,	and	doubting	herself,	and	feeling	so	damnedstupid	it	took	a	superhuman	effort	some	days	just	to	breatheâ€”is	this:	all	thepeople	who	come	after	your	dad	now	to	get	his	storyâ€”the	historians,	thescholars,	the	merely	curiousâ€”they	just	donâ€™t	get	it.What	the	Nazis	did	to	your	father	lives	in	him,	and	always	will.	That	kind	ofdamage	is	permanent.But	this	is	important.	Pay	attention	now.	What	your	parents	did	then	was	notabout	protecting	you.	It	was	about	protecting	him.	And	that	makes	you	strongerthan	him.	It	makes	you	better.	It	meansâ€¦the	truth	about	that	knife	is	yours,	too.Never	swallow	a	lie	and	ask	for	seconds.	Donâ€™t	believe	a	story	that	isnâ€™t	yours.Your	words	are	the	knife,	real	and	tangible,	and	they	carry	a	terrible	weight.You	are	the	author	of	your	life,	and	the	knife	is	yours.It	is	yours.

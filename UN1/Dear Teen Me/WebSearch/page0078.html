FINDING	YOUR	VOICEEllen	HopkinsDear	Teen	Me,Your	life	was	unusual	from	the	start.	You	were	adopted	at	birth.	Your	motherwas	forty-two	when	you	were	born,	the	â€œMayâ€	to	your	fatherâ€™s	â€œDecember.â€	Hewas	seventy-two,	and	to	put	that	into	perspective,	he	was	born	in	1883.	The	sonof	German	immigrants	and	the	definition	of	a	â€œself-made	man,â€	your	dadparlayed	a	sixth-grade	education	into	a	couple	of	thriving	businesses.	He	madehis	million	dollars	not	long	before	he	brought	nine-day-old	you	home	to	abeautiful	Spanish-style	house	in	Palm	Springs,	California.	Comedian	Bob	Hopelived	next	door	and,	having	adopted	a	slew	of	kids	himself,	he	sent	his	nannyover	to	help	out	for	a	few	days.	You	were,	of	course,	much	too	young	toappreciate	this.	But	letâ€™s	just	say	that	few	enough	people	are	given	such	anauspicious	beginning.The	truth	is,	you	were	a	child	of	privilege.	Not	so	much	because	of	money(though	you	never	went	without),	but	because	of	a	very	large	measure	of	loveinfusing	your	childhood.	You	were	doted	on,	and	while	your	parentsâ€™	agedenied	activities	some	families	sharedâ€”skiing	or	mountain	biking,	for	instanceâ€”your	mom	and	dad	rewarded	you	with	things	many	children	never	have.	Youtook	piano	and	voice	lessons.	Studied	danceâ€”ballet,	tap,	jazz,	even	hula.	Youhad	dogs,	cats,	canaries,	a	lizard	or	two.	You	owned	horses	and	rode	fearlesslyâ€”barefoot,	bare-headed,	and	barebackâ€”across	the	desert	and	into	the	hills.Your	mother	read	to	you	every	day,	taught	you	to	read	on	your	own	before	youeven	started	kindergarten.	From	her,	you	developed	an	ear	for	language	and	apassion	for	classic	literature	and	poetry.	Your	father	was	no	Puritan,	but	hewanted	you	to	have	faith,	and	made	sure	you	went	to	church	every	Sunday.From	him,	you	learned	the	value	of	honesty	and	hard	work.	A	favorite	saying	ofhis	stuck	with	you:	Anything	worth	doing	is	worth	doing	right.You	went	to	a	great	private	school,	where	creative	teachers	encouraged	yourtalents.	You	excelled	at	academics,	especially	anything	English	or	writing-related.	You	published	a	poem	when	you	were	just	nine.	Won	trophies	for	yourequestrian	skills,	ribbons	at	track	meets.	You	aced	piano	recitals	and	dance

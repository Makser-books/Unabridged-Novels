JEKYLL	&	HYDECaridad	FerrerDear	Teen	Me,Youâ€™ve	got	a	bad	case	of	the	Jekyll	and	Hydes.	I	mean,	sans	the	whole	split-personality	thing,	it	pretty	much	nails	you,	doesnâ€™t	it?	Câ€™mon,	letâ€™s	examine	theevidence.Thereâ€™s	the	side	thatâ€™s	crazy	shy	(letâ€™s	refer	to	this	as	the	Jekyll	half)	and	borninto	a	family	that	Just	Doesnâ€™t	Get	It.	They	donâ€™t	even	know	how	to	spell	shy.Your	dad	is	the	life	of	the	party;	your	mother	is	a	natural	attention	(read:â€œmanâ€)	magnet;	your	brother	could	sell	ice	to	an	Eskimo,	and	your	sisterâ€™s	ideaof	a	good	time	is	going	into	a	room	where	she	doesnâ€™t	know	a	single	soul.	Andthatâ€™s	just	your	immediate	family.	The	rest	of	the	relatives?	They	arenâ€™t	anybetter,	most	of	them	falling	under	some	variation	on	a	theme	of	ExtremeExtrovert.Pfft.To	you,	shoving	bamboo	shoots	under	your	fingernails	sounds	like	a	betteralternative	to	small	talk.So	to	say	they	donâ€™t	understand	what	you	mean	when	you	say	youâ€™re	feelingshy	is	putting	it	mildly.	They	think	itâ€™s	a	silly	pretense,	especially	when	youbalk	at	being	paraded	in	public	like	a	trained	monkey,	playing	the	BachInvention	that	won	you	that	piano	competition	or	reciting	the	poem	that	yourfifth-grade	teacher	insisted	on	entering	in	the	Dade	County	Youth	Fair,	andwhich	won	first	place.	Which	brings	us	to	the	second	reason	why	they	have	ahard	time	understanding	your	reactions.	After	all,	why	on	earth	do	you	entercompetitions	if	you	donâ€™t	want	the	attention,	right?Which	brings	us	to	Hyde.	That	side	of	your	personality	is	as	competitive	asJekyll	is	shy.	But	explaining	that	you	love	competitionâ€”that	you	lovecompeting	against	yourself	as	much	as	you	love	competing	against	othersâ€”isusually	met	with	blank	stares.	They	donâ€™t	get	that	youâ€™re	simply	incapable	oftaking	on	a	pursuit	if	you	donâ€™t	intend	to	become	the	best	you	personally	can.Which	has	the	unexpected	side	benefit	of	allowing	you	to	fake	itâ€”people	will

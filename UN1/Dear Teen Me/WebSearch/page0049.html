Take	a	breath.Write.Listen	to	music.And	then	write	some	more.You	can	do	this.	I	promise.I	know	you	feel	lost.	You	want	to	talk	to	someone	about	it,	but	you	feel	likeyour	family	and	friends	donâ€™t	understandâ€”and,	well,	they	donâ€™t.	But	neither	doyou,	right?	This	whole	thing	is	new	to	everyone,	and	no	one	knows	quite	howto	act	or	what	to	say	or	what	to	do.	Donâ€™t	let	all	that	confusion	stop	you.	Tellthem	how	lost	you	feel.	Let	them	help	you.And	try	not	to	trade	your	friends	for	those	idiot	boyfriends	I	can	see	creepingup.	Once	upon	a	timeâ€”okay,	just	a	year	before	you	were	first	diagnosedâ€”youwere	interested	in	sweet,	decent	guys.	But	when	your	confidence	began	toplummet	and	you	started	doubting	yourself,	you	left	your	friends	behind	andstarted	gravitating	toward	losers.I	get	it.	I	do.	Things	with	your	friends	have	gotten	a	little	weird.	You	hate	thatthey	always	have	to	drive	you	around	and	read	the	menu	to	you.	You	feel	likeyouâ€™re	a	burden	to	them.	Meanwhile,	those	guys	make	you	feel	wanted.Normal.	And	they	never	ask	you	any	questions	about	your	eyesight,	whichcomes	as	a	reliefâ€”even	though	your	friends	are	only	asking	because	theyactually	care	(which	is	more	than	I	can	say	about	those	guys).	So	instead	ofdrowning	yourself	in	the	loser	brigade	and	getting	hung	up	on	what	you	canâ€™tdo,	focus	your	energy	on	what	you	can	do.Stay	away	from	the	guy	who	acts	like	you	have	to	be	with	him	every	wakingmoment	(he	cheats	on	you	when	youâ€™re	out	with	your	friends).	Run	from	theguy	who	demeans	you,	insults	you,	and	throws	your	eyesight	in	your	face	likeitâ€™s	something	shameful	that	no	one	but	him	would	ever	put	up	with	(thatâ€™semotional	abuseâ€”and	he	has	no	right	to	treat	you	like	that).	These	guys	knowthey	donâ€™t	deserve	you,	but	they	also	know	your	eyesight	has	made	youinsecure	and	self-consciousâ€”weaknesses	that	losers	like	them	are	looking	toprey	on.	Youâ€™re	not	a	loser,	so	donâ€™t	date	guys	who	treat	you	like	one.	Havingan	eye	disease	doesnâ€™t	make	you	any	less	of	a	human	being.And	the	other	guy?	The	one	that	you	think	is	so	different	from	the	others?	Iknow	how	nice	he	seemsâ€”and	he	is	nice.	He	doesnâ€™t	call	you	names	or	put	youdown,	and	he	always	puts	you	first.

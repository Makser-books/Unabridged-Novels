BAD	GIRLTara	KellyDear	Teen	Me,You	meet	her	your	freshman	year.	Youâ€™re	the	awkward	new	kid	who	dresseslike	a	goth	one	day	and	like	your	mother	the	next.	Sheâ€™s	the	â€œschool	slut,â€	thekind	of	girl	every	other	girl	warns	you	about.	But	sheâ€™ll	be	the	first	person	toreach	out	to	youâ€¦the	only	person.Sheâ€™s	not	the	most	beautiful	girl	youâ€™ve	ever	seen,	but	everyone	notices	her.	Itâ€™snot	her	clothes.	She	dresses	like	a	lot	of	girls,	vintage	jeans	and	baby	tees	with	alogo	or	a	slogan	across	the	chest.	Itâ€™s	not	her	sunshine	hair	or	her	scarletlipstick.	Itâ€™s	not	even	her	voice,	rough	and	sweet	at	the	same	time.	Itâ€™s	theunconscious	things,	the	little	things.	The	way	her	lips	are	always	turned	up.	Thesway	of	her	hips.	The	look	in	her	eyesâ€”sheâ€™s	seen	enough	life	for	someonetwice	her	age.The	two	of	you	always	sneak	off	campus	at	lunch.	Sometimes	you	go	to	thepark.	Sometimes	her	apartment.	She	talks	about	guys	between	drags	of	MarbReds	(the	only	brand	to	smoke,	in	her	opinion).	Sheâ€™s	always	dating	some	olderguyâ€¦sometimes	a	lot	older.	You	think	itâ€™s	pretty	creepy,	but	you	donâ€™t	tell	herso.	Sheâ€™s	not	the	first	girl	youâ€™ve	known	whoâ€™s	dated	older	guys.	And	you	donâ€™twant	her	to	know	how	inexperienced	you	are.	You	donâ€™t	want	her	to	know	a	lotof	things.You	wonder	why	she	hangs	out	with	you,	why	she	doesnâ€™t	see	you	for	the	dorkyou	think	you	are.	A	big	night	for	you	is	hanging	out	at	the	park	with	your	bestfriend	and	his	skater	buddies,	trying	to	get	brain	freeze	from	Slurpees.	But	yourfirst	night	with	her	is	something	youâ€™ll	never	forget.	Nothing	major	happens,but	itâ€™s	your	first	taste	of	her	worldâ€”a	world	that	will	soon	become	yours.She	sends	some	guys	to	your	house	to	pick	you	up	while	she	gets	ready.	Sheonly	just	met	these	guys	the	day	before.	They	show	up	in	this	old	muscle	car.You	wonâ€™t	remember	the	make	or	modelâ€¦just	that	it	was	green	and	loud.	Sheâ€™sdating	the	driver,	who	looks	and	dresses	a	lot	like	Spike	in	Buffy	The	VampireSlayer	(youâ€™ll	see	what	I	mean	in	a	couple	years).	He	likes	his	car	and	his	metal

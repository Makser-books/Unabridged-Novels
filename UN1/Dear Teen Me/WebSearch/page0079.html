competitions.	By	anyoneâ€™s	measure,	these	were	successes.	Yet,	somehow,	yougrew	up	feelingâ€¦not	good	enough.This	probably	took	root	in	the	knowledge	that	you	were	given	away	as	a	baby.Your	parents	were	friends	with	the	doctor	who	arranged	the	adoption.	Curiousabout	where	you	came	from,	when	you	were	five	you	eavesdropped	on	one	oftheir	conversations	and	heard	the	doctor	say,	â€œEllen	isnâ€™t	nearly	as	pretty	as	[herhalf-sister].â€	Later,	you	understood	your	birth	mother	was	only	sixteen,unmarried,	and	unequipped	to	parent.	But	as	a	small	child,	the	message	seemedclear:	Not	pretty	enough	equaled	unworthy.	Your	birth	mother	kept	her	otherdaughter.	She	rejected	you.	You	stashed	that	away,	in	a	cabinet	deep	inside	you,and	there	it	will	stay	into	adulthood.Elementary	school	was	your	â€œchubbyâ€	phase.	The	kids	would	chant	â€œElsie	theCow,â€	followed	by	a	rousing	chorus	of	moos.	And	though	you	shed	those	fewextra	pounds	before	seventh	grade,	the	mirror	will	always	reflect	a	fat	girl.	Notthin	enough	meant	unlikeable.	In	a	way,	you	denied	yourself.	The	Guernseygoes	into	the	internal	cupboard,	too.So	now	youâ€™re	a	teen.	Moving	to	a	small	town	the	summer	before	your	eighthgrade	year	means	starting	high	school	as	the	quintessential	new	kid.	Just	abouteveryone	else	here	has	been	friends	since	kindergarten,	but	you	donâ€™t	knowanyone.	That	puts	you	on	the	perimeter	of	some	tightly	closed	circles,	trying	topush	your	way	inside.	Outsiders	rarely	reach	â€œin	crowdâ€	status,	and	no	matterhow	nice	you	are	to	the	cheerleaders,	you	are	no	exception.	Instead,	you	findacceptance	among	the	intelligentsia,	artistes,	and	anti-establishmentarians.	Inother	words,	the	stoners.And	then,	when	youâ€™re	sixteen,	your	father	dies.	Suddenly,	you	have	to	grow	upvery	quickly,	to	help	your	mother	deal	with	a	funeral,	probate,	death	taxes.	Youdo	everything	you	can	to	ease	the	process,	but	she	falls	into	a	deep	depression,closes	herself	off	from	everyone,	including	you.	You	try	your	best	tounderstand	why,	and	on	some	level,	you	do.	But	itâ€™s	yet	another	rebuff,	and	thistime,	from	the	person	youâ€™re	closest	to.So	maybe	it	isnâ€™t	surprising	that	you	look	to	boys	for	approval.	Not	that	youâ€™reeasy.	Your	Lutheran	upbringing	has	given	you	a	solid	moral	compass.	Youâ€™renot	interested	in	casual	sex.	What	you	want	is	someone	who	loves	you.Someone	who	makes	you	feel	like	you	are	the	most	special	girl	in	the	world.You	definitely	connect	with	a	few	guys,	but	high	school	romances	tend	to	beshort-lived.	With	each	breakup,	you	leak	a	little	more	self-esteem.

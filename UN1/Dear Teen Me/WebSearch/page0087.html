SEIZURESCarrie	JonesDear	Teen	Me,Okay,	a	lot	of	people	write	about	their	health	problems.	And	I	get	that.	I	mean,a	lot	of	people	like	to	talk	about	their	broken	bones	and	gastrointestinal	issues,and	whatever.	Thatâ€™s	fine.	During	flu	season,	people	will	go	into	graphic	detailsabout	how	they	puked	every	two	minutes.	Theyâ€™ll	even	revel	in	details	aboutthe	consistency	of	their	vomitâ€”and	trust	me,	whether	it	was	acidic	or	chunky,it	was	definitely	gross.Youâ€™ve	never	been	one	of	those	people,	though.	Itâ€™s	not	that	you	think	sicknessshows	some	kind	of	bodily	or	spiritual	weakness	or	something	like	that.	Youjust	think	itâ€™s	boring.	And	as	far	as	youâ€™re	concerned,	thereâ€™s	nothing	worsethan	being	boring.So	when	you	were	super	little	and	broke	your	ankle	playing	tag	at	DebbieMuirâ€™s	house,	you	didnâ€™t	talk	about	it.	And	when	you	were	in	second	grade	andyou	broke	your	front	tooth,	you	didnâ€™t	talk	about	that	either.	You	even	keptyour	chronic	bronchitis	a	secret.And	now?I	guess	the	older	youâ€”that	is	to	say,	meâ€”is	sticking	to	the	plan.	Becausewriting	isnâ€™t	talking,	technically	speaking.	But	I	still	feel	this	weird	sort	ofapprehension,	of	nervousness.	A	little	voice	inside	my	head	keeps	telling	me,â€œSickness	is	boring.	Tell	a	joke,	Carrie.	Tell	a	joke.â€But	seizure	jokes	are	terrible,	evil	things.	These	are	from	Epilepsy.com:Do	you	know	what	to	do	if	someone	has	a	seizure	in	a	swimming	pool?Throw	in	the	laundry.Whatâ€™s	blue	and	doesnâ€™t	fit.	A	dead	epileptic.There	are	some	that	are	even	worse,	but	Iâ€™m	not	going	to	include	them	herebecause	Iâ€™m	nice	like	that.	So,	youâ€™re	probably	wondering	why	Iâ€™m	even	telling

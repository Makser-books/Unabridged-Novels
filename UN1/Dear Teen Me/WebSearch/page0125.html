car	in	a	green	and	yellow	crocheted	blanket	so	they	could	take	him	to	thehospital.	You	knew	better	than	to	call	911,	because	ambulances	are	expensive,and	nobody	in	the	family	can	afford	them.And	now	youâ€™re	holed	up	in	the	laundry	room,	air	thick	and	warm	and	springfresh,	and	youâ€™re	going	to	rail	about	it	for	a	while.	How	he	always	does	this.How	he	runs	away	on	the	holidays	and	screws	up	birthdays,	and	how	heâ€™s	sobusy	destroying	everything	around	him	that	you	may	as	well	not	even	exist.After	a	while,	youâ€™ll	get	scared.	Youâ€™ll	bluster	about	how	youâ€™re	going	to	killhim	when	he	gets	home	from	the	hospital.	Eventually,	youâ€™ll	just	hope.	Whenthe	other	line	rings,	you	wonâ€™t	say	anything	when	your	mother	tells	you	thatyour	brother	is	dead.You	wonâ€™t	hear	anything,	either.	Later,	the	details	will	get	filled	in,	passively,randomly.	Pumped	his	stomach,	but	it	was	already	too	late.	Took	all	of	hisantidepressants,	blood	alcohol	level	was	negligible.Youâ€™ll	go	through	his	room	and	discover	somebody	else	was	in	the	house	thatday,	because	all	of	his	Metallica	tapes	are	missing.	There	will	be	a	funeralwhere	you	walk	out	on	God,	and	so	many	people	in	the	house,	and	for	somereason,	Mom	will	bring	that	yellow	and	green	blanket	home.When	you	get	evicted	from	public	housingâ€”bloodlessly	informed	that	you	nolonger	meet	minimum	occupation	requirements	for	a	three-bedroom	apartmentâ€”the	blanket	will	go	with	you.	In	the	new	apartment,	itâ€™ll	be	there,	on	thecouch.	On	the	chair.	Youâ€™ll	put	it	away	and	wish	you	could	burn	it.	Itâ€™s	ashroud,	exactly	the	shape	of	death;	youâ€™ll	hate	it	because	sometimes	youâ€™ll	needa	break	from	hating	yourself.But	that	afghan	didnâ€™t	kill	him,	and	neither	did	you.	It	doesnâ€™t	matter	that	youtried	to	OD	two	years	ago,	taking	pills	off	that	same	windowsill.	He	wasnâ€™tthinking	about	you	that	day.	It	wasnâ€™t	your	idea.	You	didnâ€™t	pull	the	trigger;there	wasnâ€™t	even	a	trigger	to	be	pulled.	Your	brother	was	mentally	ill	andcouldnâ€™t	get	the	treatment	he	needed.	He	self-medicated	until	he	couldnâ€™t	self-medicate	any	more.	It	had	nothing	to	do	with	you.Nevertheless,	itâ€™s	going	to	be	a	while	(a	couple	of	decades	at	least)	before	yourealize	all	that.	Before	you	realize	that	weâ€™re	all	dead	for	longer	than	weâ€™re	everalive.	Before	you	realize	that	shoving	him	with	your	foot	isnâ€™t	the	same	askicking	him	with	jackboots.	Before	you	understand	that	you	were	there	thatday,	you	were	one	of	the	players,	but	the	story	wasnâ€™t	about	you	at	all.

A	little	facial	tic	that	says,	â€œHi.	I	am	receptive.	Please	initiate.â€If	youâ€™d	managed	to	contort	your	frown	a	mere	thirty	degrees	upward,	he	mightbe	dating	you	and	your	fuzzy	1980s	perm	right	now	(instead	of	that	girl	withthe	bubble	butt	and	colored	contacts).Because	hereâ€™s	the	thing	I	donâ€™t	think	you	realize:	It	is	actually	possible	for	aguy	to	be	attracted	to	you.	No,	youâ€™re	not	the	prettiest	girl	in	school.	And	youâ€™redefinitely	not	the	most	popular.	But	that	doesnâ€™t	mean	that	some	nice,	cute	guycouldnâ€™t	notice	you.	And	if	you	encouraged	him	with	a	friendly	grin,	he	mightbe	able	to	overcome	his	nervousness	enough	to	say	hi.	And	then	you	mighthave	a	date	for	homecoming	instead	of	being	forced	to	hang	out	on	thebleachers	with	your	wallflower	girlfriends	mouthing	the	lyrics	to	â€œForeverYoung.â€You	wonâ€™t	be,	you	know.	Your	looks	will	fade,	and	youâ€™ll	spend	money	oncreams	and	tinctures	to	try	and	buy	a	few	more	minutes	of	youthfulness.	Thatâ€™swhat	I	do	now	every	night;	I	scrub	away	dead	skin	cells	by	whatever	meansnecessary.	Iâ€™m	trying	to	look	like	you.	Thatâ€™s	because	youâ€™re	beautiful.	Allteenage	girls	are	beautiful.	Your	eyes	are	clear.	Your	skin	is	wrinkle-free.Youâ€™re	energetic	and	lovely	by	virtue	of	your	gorgeous,	enviable	youth.	Sodonâ€™t	waste	it.	Pull	your	face	up	out	of	its	foxhole.	Take	a	chance	on	the	world.Smile.Amy	Kathleen	Ryan	is	the	author	of	Vibes	(2010),	Zen	and	Xander	Undone(2011),	and	Glow	(2011)â€”the	first	book	in	the	Sky	Chasers	series.

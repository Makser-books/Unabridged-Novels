ITâ€™S	ABOUT	TO	GET	WORSEKersten	HamiltonDear	Teen	Me,Some	people	say	God	doesnâ€™t	allow	us	to	see	our	futures	because	we	wouldnâ€™thave	the	courage	to	face	all	that	trouble	and	heartbreak	if	we	saw	it	all	at	onceâ€”but	I	donâ€™t	think	thatâ€™s	true.	The	thing	is,	I	know	a	secret	that	youâ€™re	justbeginning	to	learn,	and	this	secret	isnâ€™t	just	important	for	your	dream	ofbecoming	a	writer,	itâ€™s	also	critical	to	your	survival.	So	Iâ€™m	going	to	give	you	alittle	peek	into	the	days	ahead.It	starts	with	that	litter	of	puppies.	Theyâ€™re	three	days	old,	and	their	mother	isdead.	Everyone	says	you	should	drown	them	because	theyâ€™re	going	to	dieanyway	without	a	mama	dog	to	feed	them.	Thatâ€™s	what	they	say.	Youâ€™rethirteen,	but	you	gave	up	listening	to	what	people	said	years	ago.	Youâ€™velearned	to	think	for	yourself.	You	donâ€™t	trust	adults.Your	mom	left	when	you	were	six.	She	fell	in	love	with	a	man	who	didnâ€™t	wantkids,	and	she	chose	him	over	you	and	your	brothers	and	sister.	You	havenâ€™tseen	or	heard	from	her	since	you	were	seven.Your	dad	is	an	amazing	storytellerâ€”very	charismatic.	He	can	convince	anyonethat	heâ€™s	completely,	totally	sane.	He	doesnâ€™t	tell	them	about	the	â€œvoiceâ€	thattells	him	when	to	quit	each	job	he	gets,	when	to	sleep,	when	to	eat,	and	whenitâ€™s	safe	to	walk	down	the	street.Youâ€™ve	had	it	with	death	and	loss	and	craziness.	You	decide	youâ€™re	not	going	tokill	the	innocent	little	puppies.	Not	going	to	let	it	happen.	And	thatâ€™s	a	goodchoice,	teen	self.	Youâ€™ll	save	them	all,	and	name	the	one	you	keep	Shadrach(after	they	boy	in	the	Bible	who	came	through	a	fiery	furnace	and	lived	to	tellabout	it).	Heâ€™s	a	yellow	mutt	with	a	black	muzzle,	and	heâ€™ll	repay	you	athousand,	thousand	times	for	saving	his	life.Before	Shadâ€™s	a	year	old,	the	â€œvoiceâ€	will	tell	your	dad	to	stop	talking	to	you.Youâ€™ll	have	to	make	all	your	own	decisions	from	that	moment	on,	and	youâ€™llmake	some	bad	ones.	Youâ€™ll	drop	out	of	high	school	after	your	freshman	year.Really	bad	choice.	And	because	youâ€™re	not	in	school,	no	one	will	notice	when

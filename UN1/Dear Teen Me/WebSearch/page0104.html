HE	BROKE	MORE	THAN	YOUR	HEARTStephanie	KuehnertDear	Teen	Me,It	started	when	he	made	you	give	Acacia	that	poor,	pink,	stuffed	duck	that	heâ€™dburned	and	stabbed	and	defaced	with	permanent	marker	with	words	likeSkunkhead,	which	was	supposed	to	insult	Acacia	because	sheâ€™d	bleached	half	ofher	black	hair	blond.	â€œSheâ€™s	copying	you,â€	he	said,	referring	to	the	blond	streakyouâ€™d	had	in	your	hair	for	three	months.	You	said	you	didnâ€™t	see	it	that	way,	buthe	insisted,	â€œSheâ€™s	jealous	of	youâ€”of	us	being	together.	Sheâ€™s	been	spreadingrumors	about	us.â€You	doubted	this	and	you	were	right	to.	He	cut	you	off	from	Acacia	first	for	thesimple	reason	that	she	was	the	biggest	threat.	If	the	two	of	you	had	stayed	close,she	wouldâ€™ve	noticed	what	he	was	doing	to	you.	He	said	that	she	was	out	to	getyou.	You	believed	him,	because	he	was	the	first	boy	to	tell	you	that	he	lovedyou.He	even	said	it	before	you	did.	Youâ€™d	only	been	together	for	two	weeks.	It	wasearth-shattering.	This	gorgeous	guyâ€”a	talented	musician	who	looked	like	adark-haired,	hazel-eyed	Kurt	Cobain	and	smelled	like	sandalwood	incense,cigarettes,	and	warm	sheetsâ€”loved	you,	a	girl	who	had	just	been	used	by	twoother	gorgeous	guys.Of	course	if	he	really	had	been	like	Kurt	Cobain,	he	wouldâ€™ve	joined	you	intrying	to	kick	the	convertible	filled	with	loud,	obnoxious	jocks.	They	werescreaming	catcalls	at	you,	but	instead	of	supporting	you,	he	threw	you	over	hisshoulder	and	lifted	your	skirt,	flashing	your	underwear	to	the	busy	street.	Whenyou	started	to	cry,	he	got	pissed	and	said	you	couldnâ€™t	take	a	joke.	He	also	saidyour	skirt	was	too	short	and	those	fishnet	tights	made	you	look	like	a	slut.	Aftera	few	more	arguments	like	this,	including	one	where	he	shredded	your	favoriteshirt,	you	adopted	a	baggy,	multilayered	uniform.You	were	all	he	had	(he	said),	so	when	you	did	something	to	upset	him,	he	toldyou	he	wanted	to	die.	You	did	whatever	you	could	to	avoid	this,	includinghaving	sex	with	him	when	you	didnâ€™t	want	to.	He	was	your	first,	and	the	sex

before	you	got	on	the	plane.So	after	your	dad	died	you	stayed	in	America,	but	like	Mrs.	Newman,	youworried	that	you	had	just	killed	your	dancing	careerâ€”because	dancers	startyoung,	and	they	also	stop	young.	Most	dancing	careers	end	by	the	time	thedancers	reach	their	mid-thirties.Your	stepmother	moved	your	family	to	La	Mesa,	where	you	went	toGrossmont,	and	thatâ€™s	where	you	are	when	this	picture	is	taken.	Youâ€™ve	found	agreat	studio,	where	you	take	every	class	you	can,	starting	with	the	baby	classand	ending	at	nine	at	night.	You	come	home	from	hours	of	practice	soexhausted	that	you	step	into	the	shower	in	your	leotard	and	tights,	lean	againstthe	tile,	and	fall	asleep.	You	stretch	your	legs	over	your	head	and	hook	yourtoes	under	the	lip	of	your	headboard	and	lie	like	that	for	hours.And	you	keep	listening,	endlessly,	to	â€œLady	Jane,â€	choreographing	it	in	yourhead.	And	one	day,	your	stepmother	sees	tears	streaming	down	your	face,	andasks	you	why	youâ€™re	crying.â€œItâ€™s	the	music.	Itâ€™s	so	beautiful,â€	you	say.She	gives	you	a	classic	what	the	hell?	stare.	What	you	have	said	is	notcomputing	in	her	mind.â€œIf	it	makes	you	cry,â€	she	asks,	â€œwhy	do	you	listen	to	it?â€Sheâ€™s	genuinely	bewildered,	and	you	wonder	if	itâ€™s	weird	to	cry	when	listeningto	beautiful	music.	You	try	to	remember	if	anyone	in	ballet	school	in	Germanycried	like	that.	But	in	Germany,	you	guys	were	completely	focused	on	yourtraining,	and	afterward,	those	crazy	kids	spoke	to	each	other	in	a	language	thatwas	not	English.	You,	being	a	Californian,	opted	for	Spanish	as	your	WorldLanguage	(that	is,	before	you	dropped	out	of	school).	So	as	far	as	you	know,	noone	in	your	Balletthochschule	ever	sobbed	along	to	Brian	Jonesâ€™s	dulcimertrack.In	this	time	of	uncertainty,	your	stepmother	adds	that	dancers	never	make	anymoney	and	they	get	injured	all	the	time.	She	says	that	when	the	injuries	are	badenough	they	end	up	teaching	classes	at	the	YMCA.And	so,	in	this	picture	of	you	at	the	gym,	you	are,	frankly,	falling	apart.	Youâ€™reworried	about	getting	injured	and	winding	up	at	the	YMCA	(where	you	alreadyhave	a	job	for	the	summer).	Youâ€™re	stressing	that	you	and	your	dancers	wonâ€™tbe	able	to	dance	the	Jaggerverse	into	reality,	and	youâ€™re	worried	that	worryingabout	it	means	youâ€™re	psycho.	Because	that	is	weird,	right?

BEST	FRIENDS	FOREVER	(FOR	REAL)Lauren	Oliver	and	Elizabeth	MilesDear	Teen	Elizabeth	(from	Lauren	Oliver),First	off,	let	me	say:	You	really	got	me	through	high	school.	Without	yoursupport	and	friendship,	Iâ€™m	not	sure	I	would	have	made	it	out.	So,	thank	you.Iâ€™m	very	happy	to	tell	you	that	you	will	grow	into	a	beautiful,	accomplished,and	beloved	young	woman,	and	Iâ€™m	even	happier	to	tell	you	that	you	and	I	willremain	best	friends.There	are	a	few	other	pieces	of	information	Iâ€™d	like	to	send	along	your	way,	sobear	with	me.1.	First	off,	your	hair	looks	super	cute	when	itâ€™s	really	short.	Go	ahead	andlop	it	off!	Youâ€™ll	look	like	a	beneficent	pixie.2.	Secondly,	DONâ€™T	SMOKE.	Seriously.	Put	down	the	cigarettes	NOW.	Ifyou	donâ€™t,	you	and	I	will	struggle	with	quitting	throughout	our	twenties.	Ittotally	isnâ€™t	worth	it.3.	Remember	all	those	boys	who	broke	our	hearts	over	the	years?	Therewas	Brett	(you),	Dan	Waitman	(me),	Steve	(me	again),	Brett	again	(you);there	were	Jons	and	Adams	and	Matts	and	countless	others.	Sometimes	wesuffered	for	days	or	weeks.	Sometimes	we	cried,	sometimes	we	starved,	andsometimes	we	couldnâ€™t	stop	eatingâ€”but	we	always	leaned	on	each	other(and	on	an	occasional	dose	of	Pride	and	Prejudice	and	a	certain	Mr.	ColinFirth)	to	get	us	through.I	wonâ€™t	say	now	that	those	experiences	werenâ€™t	worth	it,	but	you	shouldknow	that	they	were	just	like	the	math	problems	we	had	to	do	in	calcâ€”their	greatest	worth	was	that	they	taught	us	process.	In	the	case	of	calc,	welearned	how	to	think;	in	the	case	of	the	Toms,	Jons,	and	Adams,	welearned	how	to	how	to	feel	and	to	love.	It	wasnâ€™t	about	the	particulars,	butthe	generals:	All	that	heartbreak	helped	us	learn	how	to	heal,	and	it	helpedus	become	better	and	better	at	relationships.4.	Your	parents	are	great	in	some	ways	and	crazy	in	others.	So	are	mine.They	wonâ€™t	necessarily	understand	us	any	better	as	we	get	older.	But	we

FRIENDS	IN	DARK	PLACESCynthia	Leitich	SmithDear	Teen	Me,Youâ€™ve	had	enough	of	the	quarters	game	in	the	kitchen,	the	â€œPink	Floydâ€	albumin	the	rec	room,	and	the	whispers	and	stares	everywhere	else.	A	girl	on	yourhigh	school	newspaper	staff	just	told	you	he	was	here.	You	have	to	get	away.Youâ€™re	not	ready	to	see	him	yet.Itâ€™s	more	than	that	actually.	Youâ€™re	not	ready	for	everyone	else	to	dissect	howyou	two	interactâ€¦or	donâ€™t.	Maybe	that	sounds	superficial,	but	this	is	socialtheater,	and	youâ€™re	the	leading	lady	of	the	week.	Youâ€™re	not	about	to	let	themsee	you	crumble.What	are	you	doing	here	anyway?	You	barely	know	the	girl	whose	parents(currently	out	of	town)	own	this	place.	Maybe	your	best	friend	had	a	point:Moping	at	home	wasnâ€™t	helping,	but	offering	yourself	up	as	the	focus	oftonightâ€™s	drama	wasnâ€™t	the	best	idea	either.For	the	first	time,	a	boyfriend	has	told	you	that	he	doesnâ€™t	want	you	anymore.Youâ€™ve	been	together	for	months.	Youâ€™ve	gone	on	countless	variations	of	hispreferred	date:	dinner	at	a	chain	restaurant	followed	by	the	yogurt	shop	orminiature	golf.	Youâ€™ve	been	to	church	with	his	family,	and	heâ€™s	celebrated	theholidays	with	yours.	Your	parents	like	him,	especially	your	dad.	They	connectover	football.Was	it	because	youâ€™re	a	virgin?	Is	that	why	he	dumped	you?	He	neverpressured.	He	never	even	brought	it	up.	But	thatâ€™s	what	your	gut	says.In	your	suburban	high	school,	it	seems	like	a	cheerleader	gets	pregnant	everysingle	year.	Youâ€™re	horrified	by	how	people	turn	their	backs	on	those	girls,	andyouâ€™re	determined	that	it	wonâ€™t	happen	to	you.	Could	he	sense	that?The	split-level	house	is	crowded.	You	squeeze	past	drunken	kids	to	reach	thesecond	floor.	Someone	asks	if	you	know	heâ€™s	there,	and	you	pretend	not	tohear.	Couples	are	making	out	in	the	bathroom	and	in	the	bedrooms	you	pass.You	slip	into	the	master,	where	coats	and	purses	are	piled	on	the	bed,	and	shut

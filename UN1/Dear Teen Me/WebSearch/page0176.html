BOYS	BOYS	BOYSErika	StalderDear	Teen	Me,Letâ€™s	talk	about	boys.	I	know,	I	knowâ€”you	think	the	topic	is	overhyped	andundervalued.	And	youâ€™re	annoyed	that	seemingly	all	the	chicks	around	you	areconsumedâ€”consumed!â€”by	boy	stuff.	I	really	canâ€™t	blame	you	for	thinkingâ€œGawdâ€”enough	already!â€	What	with	your	best	friend	dating	a	twenty-five-year-old	gangster	with	jailhouse	tattoos	and	a	gunplay	fetish	(not	to	mention	athing	for	MUCH	younger,	virginal	girlsâ€”gross!),	and	your	carpool	buddy	whorhapsodizes	on	and	on	about	her	boy	exploitsâ€¦Itâ€™s	pretty	exhausting.And	of	course	it	doesnâ€™t	help	that	your	first	date	was	with	a	guy	who	drove	awindowless	van	(which	he	borrowed),	and	who	didnâ€™t	bring	enough	money	toeven	cover	his	own	tab.	Or	that	most	of	the	hotties	in	your	tiny	school	act	likedopey	surfer	brahs	who	consume	beerios	(yes,	thatâ€™s	Cheerios	in	beerâ€”ugh)	forbreakfast.	But	humor	me.Try	to	be	nicer	to	the	boys	in	your	school.	Even	though	the	boy	frontier	istumultuous,	embarrassingly	underexplored,	and	sometimes	a	downright	hassle,high	school	guys	are	trying	to	get	by	just	like	you.	Theyâ€™re	worried	aboutwhether	their	V	cards	have	surpassed	the	socially	acceptable	use-by	date.	Andtheyâ€™ve	all	got	that	girl	they	desperately	want	to	talk	to	but	are	terrified	ofapproaching,	just	because	they	might	be	rejected.	And	despite	the	amount	ofmisplaced	innuendo	and	attaboying	they	engage	in,	these	guys	can	be	sincere.Sometimes,	when	a	guy	tells	you	that	you	look	pretty,	he	means	it,	and	youshould	simply	thank	him	instead	of	knowing	that	heâ€™s	messing	with	you	andflashing	your	signature	â€œdonâ€™t	eff	with	meâ€	glare.And	for	Godâ€™s	sakeâ€”when	youâ€™re	at	that	post-lip-sync	party	with	your	crush,make	a	move!	I	know	youâ€™re	all	worried	about	ruining	your	friendship	with	theguy,	but	after	high	school,	youâ€™ll	never	talk	to	him	againâ€”so	that	friendshipisnâ€™t	as	important	as	you	think.	Whatâ€™s	more,	when	you	see	him	a	year	or	sooutta	high	school,	you	wonâ€™t	even	think	heâ€™s	cute	anymoreâ€”so	get	him	whilethe	gettinâ€™s	good!	Not	only	will	he	likely	go	for	a	little	action,	but	making	thefirst	move	with	a	guy	will	be	great	practice	in	gutsiness,	semicalculated	risk

9	THINGS	YOU	NEED	TO	KNOWRobin	BenwayDear	Teen	Me,1.	Letâ€™s	just	start	by	ripping	off	the	Band-Aid.	You	need	to	let	your	bangsgrow	out.	Iâ€™m	serious.	Half	of	your	teenage	life	(thatâ€™s	a	rough	estimate,	butI	feel	like	itâ€™s	accurate)	will	be	spent	trying	to	straighten	them	and	the	otherhalf	will	be	spent	worrying	that	theyâ€™re	frizzing	up,	so	just	grow	them	outnow.	Youâ€™re	welcome.2.	High	school	stops	mattering	the	second	you	graduate	from	it.	Crazy,	Iknow,	but	itâ€™s	true!	Remember	how	upset	everyone	was	when	you	were	toolazy	forgot	to	file	your	paperwork	for	the	National	Honor	Society?	Or	whenyour	Spanish	teacher	got	mad	because	you	ditched	her	class	so	many	times?It	turns	out	that	nobody	cares	whether	or	not	you	were	an	honors	student,and	your	Spanish	skills	turn	out	to	be	quite	stellarâ€”especially	when	askingfor	directions	in	Spain	when	youâ€™re	thirty-two.	(Yes,	you	go	to	Spain.	AndItaly	and	France,	too.	Start	packing	now.)3.	That	boy	in	your	chemistry	class	isnâ€™t	just	being	friendly.	Heâ€™s	flirtingwith	you.	The	sooner	you	can	figure	out	the	difference	between	the	two,	theeasier	your	life	will	be.	And	you	really	need	to	talk	to	Chemistry	Boy	more,because	on	the	last	day	of	senior	year,	he	will	write	a	beautiful	sentence	inyour	yearbook	that	involves	him	using	the	word	â€œperpetuallyâ€	correctlyâ€”and	it	will	be	the	most	awesome	thing	that	has	ever	happened	to	you.	Sofar.4.	You	pick	amazing	friends.	All	those	girls	you	hang	out	with	atlunchtime?	Youâ€™ll	still	be	hanging	out	with	them	when	youâ€™re	all	in	yourthirties.	Theyâ€™ll	still	make	you	laugh	until	you	have	to	pee,	and	theyâ€™ll	bethe	first	ones	to	call	you	when	things	go	horribly	wrong.	(Oops,	spoileralert!)5.	Right	before	your	senior	year	of	high	school,	your	house	will	flood	whileyouâ€™re	on	vacation	with	your	family	and	youâ€™ll	come	home	to	a	totaldisaster.	Youâ€™ll	have	to	live	with	your	mother	and	younger	brother	in	ahotel	room	for	the	next	three	months,	and	while	it	seems	insane	at	the	time,the	three	of	you	will	become	closer	than	ever	before	as	a	result.	They	will

know,	your	father	is	out	there,	and	(never	mind	that	itâ€™s	five-hundred-thousanddegrees)	you	need	to	get	out	there	and	help.Your	father	routinely	gives	himself	heat	stroke,	or	at	least	comes	close.	In	fact,thatâ€™s	whatâ€™s	happening	right	now:	heâ€™s	in	the	house,	stretched	on	the	sofa,	acool	washcloth	over	his	forehead,	and	all	because	youâ€™re	an	ungrateful	wretchwho	chained	this	grown	man	to	a	lawn	mowerâ€”because,	as	we	all	know,	heâ€™sonly	doing	this	for	you.Letâ€™s	face	it.	Your	father	is	bit	of	a	maniac.	This	guyâ€¦Letâ€™s	just	say	thereâ€™s	alot	of	drama.	Dad	isâ€¦well,	mainly	heâ€™s	a	bully.	And	you?	Youâ€™re	an	idiot,stupid,	a	dummy,	a	moronâ€¦and	what	were	you	thinking,	you	jackass?He	also	has	a	tendency	to	explode.	When	he	does,	it	means	slaps,	smacks,	andspankings.	And	it	happens	a	lot.	Back	then,	this	was	acceptable	behaviorbecause	every	kid	needed	a	good	wallop	now	and	then.	One	time,	when	yourmom	came	at	you	with	a	shoe	you	just	laughed,	because	she	hit	like	a	girl.Your	father	is	a	different	story.Well,	strike	that:	Youâ€™re	not	sure	what	your	dadâ€™s	story	is,	to	tell	the	truth.	Hispast	is	a	black	hole.	He	says	he	doesnâ€™t	remember,	but	you	think	thatâ€™s	crap.	(Inthree	years,	youâ€™ll	say	bullshit,	but	right	now	thatâ€™s	a	pretty	dangerous	word,and	youâ€™re	a	good	girl.)I	mean,	seriously,	get	real.Who	forgets	Nazis?***This	is	all	theyâ€™ve	told	you:	Your	dad	was	sixâ€”or	maybe	sevenâ€”when	theNazis	came.	His	house	was	in	Alsace-Lorraine;	or	no,	it	was	Schneidach;	no,your	half-cousin	said	it	was	in	Munich.	Anyway,	the	Nazis	took	them	all:	mom,dad,	grandmother,	and	your	fatherâ€”then	just	a	little	kid.	The	family	bouncedaround	from	camp	to	camp	to	camp.Thenâ€¦everyone	died.	Well,	everyone	except	your	dad.	Somehow	he	ended	upin	Delaware.	The	rest	of	his	family	was	gassed	in	Auschwitz.	Period,	end	ofstory.When	you	ask	for	more,	youâ€™re	told	there	is	none.	Dad	doesnâ€™t	rememberâ€¦No,he	doesnâ€™t	want	to	talk	about	itâ€¦No,	no,	it	was	all	so	long	ago,	and	anyway,donâ€™t	you	have	some	homework	to	do?

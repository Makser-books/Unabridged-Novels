Some	things	donâ€™t	add	up.	For	one	thing,	your	dad	doesnâ€™t	have	a	tattoo.Youâ€™ve	looked.	For	another,	your	dad	loves	German	shepherds	and	Mercedes-Benzes,	and	what	gives	with	that?Onlyâ€¦your	dad	also	guards	his	food.	He	really	does.	And	talk	about	a	temper.A	couple	times,	your	momâ€™s	had	to	pull	him	off	you.	Once,	you	even	thoughthe	was	going	to	hammer	her.	Step	out	of	line	and	everyone	pays.So	thereâ€™s	this	dangerous	guy	with	no	pastâ€¦And	now,	as	a	result,	youâ€™ve	madeup	stories	to	fill	the	gaps.	He	and	his	father	were	resistance	fighters;	no,	theybroke	out	of	camp;	no,	his	father	smuggled	your	dad	out	so	that	he	couldcontinue	the	fight	on	his	own.	Itâ€™s	all	a	little	fuzzy,	but	youâ€™ve	turned	yourfather	into	Batman,	Superman,	and	the	Lone	Ranger.And	now,	right	there,	is	the	knife	that	proves	it.***Hereâ€™s	what	you	do.You	leave	the	knife	and,	flushed	with	excitement,	run	inside:	Dad,	Dad,	I	foundthis	knife,	this	Nazi	knife!***This	is	what	they	do.Your	mother	freezes.	Your	father	stares	at	you	from	the	couch.	Neither	says	aword.	Thereâ€™s	a	very	long	moment,	a	very	pregnant	moment,	when	you	wonderif	you	should	repeat	what	youâ€™ve	just	said.	Maybe	your	dad	didnâ€™t	understand?Maybe	heat	stroke	cooked	his	brain?Then	your	father	sits	up,	very	slowly,	and	swings	his	legs	down.	â€œLet	me	checkthis	out,â€	he	says.	â€œYou	stay	here.â€He	heads	for	the	garage;	your	mom	stays	mum;	and	you	do	what	youâ€™re	told.But	youâ€™re	beside	yourself.	Youâ€™ve	been	vindicated:	Yeah,	sâ€™plain	that,	Lucy!Finally,	the	family	room	door	opens	again	and	you	look	up,	thrilled,	becausenow	he	will	have	to	tellâ€¦But	his	hands	are	empty.â€œWhere	is	it?â€	Youâ€™re	almost	tempted	to	look	behind	his	back,	like	you	didwhen	you	were	little	and	he	made	things	poof	for	peek-a-boo.	Later,	you	duck

RAISING	MEHeather	DavisDear	Teen	Me,Itâ€™s	not	easy	raising	yourself	and	your	sisters,	and	itâ€™s	not	fair.	Even	all	theseyears	later,	as	I	look	back	at	all	youâ€™re	going	through,	it	still	makes	me	mad.What	kind	of	a	mother	bails	out	on	her	daughters?The	day	your	parents	told	you	they	were	getting	divorced	you	were	secretlyhappy	that	you	and	your	sisters	would	be	living	with	Dad,	but	you	had	no	wayof	knowing	that	Mom	was	going	to	move	out	of	town.	And	then	out	of	state.And	then	out	of	your	lives	altogether.You	had	no	way	of	knowing	that	your	grandmother	would	be	the	one	to	takeyou	to	be	fitted	for	your	first	bra.	She	would	have	to	be	the	one	to	buy	you	thatmassive	box	of	feminine	pads	(which	would	sit	on	your	shelf,	untouched,	forwhat	seemed	like	forever).You	had	no	way	of	knowing	that	your	dad	would	come	to	rely	on	you	to	takecare	of	your	younger	sisters.	That	you	would	be	the	responsible	one.	The	onewho	doesnâ€™t	want	to	let	anyone	down.	The	one	who	your	sisters	look	up	to	andthen	later	resentâ€”after	all,	youâ€™re	more	than	a	sister,	but	less	than	a	parent.But	you	donâ€™t	blame	Dadâ€”how	could	you?	Heâ€™s	a	single	parent,	coming	intohis	own	true	identity	away	from	Mom,	trying	his	best	to	help	you	along	theway.	If	anything,	you	should	give	him	a	hug	and	tell	him	that	you	understand.Years	later,	heâ€™ll	be	one	of	your	very	best	friends.Youâ€™re	in	the	toughest	part	of	it	all	right	now.	During	these	teen	years,	yourmother	will	blow	into	town	every	once	in	a	while	to	ask	personal	questions	andobserve	you	like	youâ€™re	some	kind	of	science	experiment:	Did	you	get	yourperiod	yet?	Are	you	shaving	your	legs	now?	Did	you	pluck	your	eyebrows?And	even	though	it	makes	you	uncomfortable,	you	answer,	because	she	is	yourmother.	You	answer	because	you	feel	you	should.	You	answer	because	youdonâ€™t	want	to	disappoint	herâ€”which	is	so	messed	up,	because	all	the	whilesheâ€™s	the	one	whoâ€™s	disappointing	you.

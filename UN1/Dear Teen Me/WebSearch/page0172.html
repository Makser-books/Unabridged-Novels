Of	all	people,	itâ€™s	the	girl	whoâ€™s	been	bullying	you	fromthe	day	you	first	moved	to	this	district,	back	in	fourth	grade.	She	spray-paintedthe	word	â€œBitchâ€	on	your	driveway,	and	mocked	your	discount-store	clothes.Thatâ€™s	why	youâ€™re	a	cheerleader.	You	tried	out	for	the	wardrobe	that	came	withit.	Who	wouldâ€™ve	guessed	youâ€™d	take	away	her	spot	on	the	squad?After	that,	she	faded	into	the	background.	Until	tonight.	Has	she	been	waitingfor	the	opportunity	to	attack?	You	feel	exposed,	vulnerable.â€œYouâ€™re	too	good	for	him,â€	she	announces,	and	you	assume	itâ€™s	a	trick.You	brace	yourself	for	the	punch	line.	You	brace	yourself	to	be	the	punch	line,like	you	had	been	for	many	years	before.	But	it	doesnâ€™t	come.	Sheâ€™s	sincere.Has	the	world	turned	upside	down?â€œWhy	are	you,	of	all	people,	being	nice	to	me?â€	you	demand	with	more	spiritthan	youâ€™ve	ever	shown	her,	toe-to-toe,	before.She	blames	the	past	on	jealousy.	She	tells	you	how	much	you	wow	her.Itâ€™s	a	small	miracle.	If	she	can	change,	then	you	will,	too.	No	more	hiding.	Yougo	downstairs	to	confront	the	boy.	To	ask	what	went	wrong.Years	later,	you	wonâ€™t	care	enough	to	remember	what	he	said.In	the	end,	that	wonâ€™t	be	the	conversation	that	mattered.Cynthia	Leitich	Smith	is	the	New	York	Times	best-selling	author	of	theTantalize	series,	award-winning	books	for	younger	readers	and	numerous	shortstories.

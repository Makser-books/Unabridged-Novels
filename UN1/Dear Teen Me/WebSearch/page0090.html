â€œIâ€™m	going	to	miss	you	when	you	go,â€	Joe	says,	in	between	bursts	of	laughter.He	loves	the	scene	where	a	bunch	of	naked	women	walk	around	doingcompletely	normal	things.	Itâ€™s	his	favorite	scene	in	the	movie.â€œYeah.	Me	too.â€	You	stop	and	correct	yourself.	â€œI	mean,	Iâ€™m	going	to	missyou.â€You	scratch	at	the	weird	rash	down	by	your	ankle.	Itâ€™s	a	bizarre	array	of	reddots	and	circles.	It	isnâ€™t	bright;	just	sort	of	looks	like	faded	markers.	You	hate	itbecause	it	makes	you	imperfect.	You	also	hate	the	idea	of	leaving	Joe,	eventhough	youâ€™re	super	psyched	about	the	future	right	now,	and	about	getting	outof	the	split-level	house	with	the	ugly	brown	couch.	Youâ€™re	ready	to	leave	theentire	town	of	Bedford,	New	Hampshire,	behindâ€”because	it	seems	to	benothing	but	rich	people	(except,	that	is,	for	you).Joe	is	the	â€œyounger	manâ€â€”which	sounds	pretty	naughty,	but	isnâ€™t.	Heâ€™s	a	yearbehind	you	in	school	though,	so	youâ€™ll	be	going	to	college	first.And	because	itâ€™s	one	of	the	weaker	scenes	in	the	movie,	and	because,	eventhough	something	awful	happened	at	that	party,	you	and	Joe	are	hormonalmonsters,	you	start	to	make	out.	Kissing	Joe	is	like	kissing	sunlight.	It	energizesyou,	makes	you	all	shaky	inside,	like	youâ€™re	doped	up	on	a	caffeine	IV	orsomething	crazy	like	that.	When	you	kiss	him,	you	can	smell	him,	and	hesmells	clean,	like	white	soap	and	Lubriderm	moisturizer	(which	claims	to	befragrance-free	but	totally	smells).	Your	lips	seem	like	theyâ€™re	magnetized,	likethey	canâ€™t	help	but	be	drawn	toward	his,	and	everything	is	right	in	the	worldâ€¦until	IT	happens.	Youâ€™re	inhaling	that	smell	when	he	breaks	away	and	says,â€œYour	lips	are	kind	of	dry.â€â€œOh!â€	you	grab	for	your	Pepsi.	â€œSorry!â€You	remember	taking	a	sipâ€¦holding	the	canâ€¦hand	shaking	in	this	weird,rhythmical	wayâ€¦Joe	grabbing	the	can,	his	eyes	all	soft	and	concernedâ€¦hisvoice	sounding	far	away.	â€œYou	okay?â€Thatâ€™s	all	you	remember.Bruce	Link	wrote,	â€œStigma	exists	when	a	person	is	identified	by	a	label	that	setsthat	person	apart	and	links	that	person	to	undesirable	stereotypes	that	result	inunfair	treatment	and	discrimination.â€The	first	step	comes	when	people	realize	that	others	are	different	fromthemselves.	They	give	those	differences	â€œlabels.â€	Next,	culture	determines	thatthose	people	with	certain	characteristics	are	representative	of	everyone	else	who

WHEN	DANCE	WAS	YOUR	WORLDNancy	HolderDear	Teen	Me,Excuse	me	for	interrupting	you	while	youâ€™re	hard	at	work.	In	the	picture	Iâ€™mlooking	at,	in	the	moment	Iâ€™m	thinking	of,	youâ€™re	choreographing	a	piece	toâ€œLady	Jane,â€	by	the	Rolling	Stones.	Youâ€™ve	organized	your	dancers	into	threegroups,	weaving	them	in	and	out	of	the	intricate	threads	of	guitar	andharpsichord	and	dulcimer.	Every	time	you	work	on	the	piece	you	canâ€™t	catchyour	breath.	Youâ€™re	nervous	and	exhilarated	and	you	wonder	if	youâ€™re	crazybecause	getting	this	right	means	so	much	to	you;	you	feel	every	note	so	deeply.The	song	sounds	plaintive,	sinister,	and	sexy	all	at	the	same	time.	You	keepseeing	Mick	Jagger	sneering	as	he	gazes	at	some	poor	Tudor	girl	sobbingbecause	heâ€™s	dumping	her.	In	your	imagination,	he	looks	like	David	Bowie	asthe	Demon	King	in	Labyrinth.	Different	rocker,	same	edge.You	are	firmly	convinced	you	have	no	edge.	Though	itâ€™s	hard	to	believe	here	inthe	future,	youâ€™re	still	very	shy	right	now.	You	donâ€™t	tell	anyone	how	deeplythat	song	moves	you,	especially	since	youâ€™re	not	totally	sure	what	itâ€™s	all	about.But	when	you	listen	to	it,	you	feel	as	if	thereâ€™s	a	world	living	and	breathinginside	the	music.	It	seems	like,	in	a	way,	the	Stones	live	there,	and	that	if	youget	the	dancers	to	feel	as	much	as	youâ€™re	feeling	through	the	movements	yougive	them,	the	Jaggerverse	will	shimmer	into	existence,	and	youâ€™ll	suddenlyfind	yourself	living	a	Bohemian	existence	downtown.Grossmont	is	your	third	high	school.	No	one	there	knows	that	less	than	a	yearago,	you	dropped	out	of	your	second	high	school	and	moved	to	Europe	tobecome	a	classical	ballet	dancerâ€”and	that	you	came	home	six	weeks	laterbecause	your	father	died	of	a	heart	attack.	When	it	happened	your	stepmothergot	you	a	ticket	homeâ€”for	the	funeral,	you	thought.	You	fully	expected	toreturn	to	Europe	to	keep	dancing,	but	your	stepmother	talked	you	into	staying	inCalifornia	and	finishing	high	school.	Which	seemed	like	the	sensible	thing	todo	at	the	time.	But	later	on	you	find	out	that	Mrs.	Newman,	your	stateside	balletteacher,	didnâ€™t	think	it	was	such	a	good	idea.	She	felt	like	youâ€™d	lose	yourchance	to	become	really	good.	But	she	never	got	the	chance	to	speak	to	you

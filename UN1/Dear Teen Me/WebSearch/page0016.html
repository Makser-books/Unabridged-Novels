REINVENTING	MECharles	BenoitDear	Teen	Me,Just	dropping	in	to	let	you	know	that	your	little	plan	actually	works.	Sure,	itseems	crazy,	and	it	doesnâ€™t	start	off	well	at	all,	but	overall	youâ€™ll	be	pleasantlysurprised	about	how	it	turns	out.Iâ€™m	stunned	you	ever	came	up	with	something	like	this	in	the	first	place.	Youcertainly	have	reason	enough	to	tryâ€”I	mean,	something	has	to	happenâ€”but	weboth	know	that	â€œdoing	thingsâ€	was	never	your	specialty.	But	not	doing	things?In	that	respect	youâ€™re	a	pro.	Not	talking	to	girls,	not	watching	what	you	eat,	notcaring	how	you	look,	not	standing	up	for	yourself,	not	trying	in	classâ€”nobodydoes	nothing	better	than	you.And	thatâ€™s	why	the	plan	seems	so	impossible.	I	mean,	itâ€™s	one	thing	to	say	youwant	to	change	your	hair;	itâ€™s	another	thing	entirely	to	say	youâ€™re	going	tochange	everything	about	yourselfâ€”the	way	you	look,	the	way	you	dress,	theway	you	talk,	who	you	talk	to,	what	you	talk	about,	what	you	watch,	what	youlisten	to,	and	where	you	plan	to	go	on	Friday	night.	Everything.	And	youâ€™vegiven	yourself	two	months	to	do	it.	Thatâ€™s	your	plan,	anyway:	the	ultimatemakeover.	If	it	worksâ€”and	given	your	track	record,	you	have	no	reason	tothink	it	willâ€”youâ€™ll	start	tenth	grade	as	a	whole	new	person.	And	if	it	fails,well,	youâ€™re	used	to	that.Granted,	you	have	friends	and	you	have	a	great	(sometimes	strange)	family,	butadmit	it:	you	arenâ€™t	happy.	You	can	picture	the	guy	you	want	to	be.	Weâ€™re	nottalking	superpowers	or	sudden	musical	genius;	all	you	want	is	to	be	the	guywho	doesnâ€™t	say	something	stupid	every	time	he	opens	his	mouth,	the	one	whodoesnâ€™t	get	picked	last	for	everything,	who	doesnâ€™t	let	jocks	push	him	around,and	who	does	know	what	to	say	to	girls.	To	put	it	simply,	you	just	donâ€™t	want	tobe	you	anymore.So	you	make	a	list.	The	cool	of	James	Bond,	the	wit	of	Steve	Martin,	the	quiettoughness	of	Bruce	Lee.	Then	you	write	up	a	bunch	of	little	playsâ€”literallywrite	them	outâ€”planning	what	youâ€™ll	say	when	you	sit	down	at	a	table	of	hot

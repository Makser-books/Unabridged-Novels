To	sum	it	up,	teen	Ellen,	this	is	how	you	see	yourself:Smart.	Pretty	much	geek-smart,	and	who	wants	to	hang	out	with	a	geek?Plain.	Youâ€™ll	never	be	pretty,	so	why	bother	with	makeup?	It	canâ€™t	hide	the	bigbump	in	your	nose.	And	forget	about	top-rung	boyfriends.	Theyâ€™re	looking	forglitzier	girls.Fat.	The	best	part	about	that	is	not	having	to	worry	about	cute	clothes.	Jeansand	baggy	T-shirts	will	do.Decent	at	dance,	choir,	drama.	To	a	degree.	You	donâ€™t	get	solos	or	leads.	Andyou	didnâ€™t	make	the	cheer	squad.Different.	Youâ€™ll	never	fit	into	mainstream	cliques.	Plus,	you	have	thisannoying	habit	of	making	friends	with	other	kids	who	are	different,	too.	Whichpushes	you	even	closer	toward	freak	distinction.Probable	yearbook	description:	Most	Likely	to	Be	Rejected.Chin	up.	You	wonâ€™t	know	this	for	a	very	long	time	(when	you	reconnect	withyour	old	classmates	through	something	called	Facebook),	but	this	is	how	otherpeople	see	you:	Smart.	Reliable.	Youâ€™re	the	one	cheaters	want	to	sit	behind	ontest	day.	Youâ€™ll	ace	your	SATs	and	get	into	the	college	of	your	choice.Pretty.	You	have	a	natural	beauty	that	doesnâ€™t	rely	on	makeup.	Donâ€™t	worryabout	your	nose.	No	one	notices	it.	Theyâ€™re	looking	at	your	smile.Fit.	Between	dance,	track,	and	horseback	riding,	youâ€™ve	got	amazing	legs	and	agreat	rear	end.	These	are	things	no	amount	of	dieting	can	achieve.Talented.	You	continue	to	publish	poetry	and	win	every	creative	writing	contestyou	enter.	And	you	sure	know	how	to	rock	â€˜nâ€™	roll.Different.	You	are	sensitive	and	more	caring	than	most.	You	are	a	rebel,	andspeak	your	mind,	especially	about	inequalities	you	see.	You	are	brave.Probable	yearbook	description:	Most	Likely	to	Take	a	Stand.You	graduate	near	the	top	of	your	class.	Tossing	that	tasseled	cap	feels	like	thefirst	step	toward	freedom.	It	is	a	sprint	toward	adulthood,	where	life	will	be	justas	confusing	as	ever.	Youâ€™ll	drop	out	of	college,	choose	the	wrong	guys.	Acouple	will	hurt	you,	and	one	will	abuse	you.	Trust	will	come	harder	andharder.	But	each	wrong	turn	makes	you	wiser.	After	a	while	youâ€™ll	realize	thatlove	isnâ€™t	about	control.	Itâ€™s	about	mutual	respect.

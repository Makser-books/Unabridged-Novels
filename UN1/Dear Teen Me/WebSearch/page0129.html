GET	BETTERHannah	MoskowitzDear	Teen	Me,So	you	have	this	CD	you	burned	a	few	weeks	ago,	and	youâ€™ve	listened	to	it	Godknows	how	many	times	now,	because	ever	since	you	got	your	license	youâ€™vehardly	left	your	car.	Itâ€™s	just	easier	to	drive	around	and	go	out	for	coffee	(whichyou	donâ€™t	like)	with	boys	(who	you	donâ€™t	like)	than	it	is	to	go	home	and	stare	atall	the	food	you	want	to	eat	and	cry	over	the	94	percent	on	your	test	(becausewhat	about	the	other	six	points).	Because	then	you	eventually	just	have	to	go	tobed	for	your	four	hours	of	sleep	before	you	have	to	repeat	the	whole	thingagainâ€¦and	againâ€¦and	again.Lately	you	have	an	extra	hour	in	the	car	every	week,	because	youâ€™re	driving	toand	from	therapy	trying	to	shake	that	eating	disorder.Youâ€™re	about	to	turn	seventeen,	and	it	doesnâ€™t	matter	how	much	you	want	to	getout	of	the	house	and	listen	to	those	same	songs	again	and	again	and	again;driving	scares	the	crap	out	of	you	(it	still	does),	so	half	the	time	you	call	andcancel	the	therapy	appointments	five	minutes	before	theyâ€™re	due	to	start,	whichmeans	your	parents	still	get	charged	the	full	amount,	which	means	your	parentsprobably	think	youâ€™re	going,	but	instead	you	lie	on	the	floor	and	count	yourribs,	and	youâ€™ve	never	hated	yourself	as	much	as	you	do	when	you	see	whatyou	are	doing	to	your	mother	all	the	hell	over	her	face.	You	take	pictures	ofyourself	sucking	in	your	stomach	and	leave	them	on	her	camera	because	youjust	donâ€™t	care	anymore,	because	this	stopped	being	fun	a	long	time	ago,	andyour	favorite	clothes	are	too	big,	and	now	the	only	good	part	of	any	of	this	isthat	CD.Iâ€™m	listening	to	the	songs	I	can	remember	from	it	while	I	write	this,	and	Iâ€™mright	back	there	in	the	parking	lot	where	you	used	to	park	illegally,	sitting	in	thecar	instead	of	going	in	to	therapy,	seat	pushed	all	the	way	back,	crying	so	hardyou	canâ€™t	breathe.	Iâ€™m	there	too.	Pretend	Iâ€™m	there	the	whole	time,	okay?Because	I	havenâ€™t	forgotten.	I	remember	you,	Hannah.And	I	know	what	you	want	to	hear	more	than	anything	else	in	the	world,	what

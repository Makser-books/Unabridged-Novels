about	boys.)	Anyway,	thatâ€™s	what	the	other	journalâ€™s	for:	sharing	fun	stuff	withfriends	and	illustrating,	on	a	frame-by-frame	basis,	our	delusions	of	grandeur.You	have	a	bedtime	diary	ritual,	too.	At	night	you	crawl	under	the	covers,	pullout	one	of	your	metallic	Gelly	Roll	pens,	and	woefully	scribble	into	the	samepages	that	you	filled	with	hope	that	very	morning.	It	goes	like	this:I	didnâ€™t	talk	to	John	today.	[Insert	explanation	here.]	I	donâ€™t	know	whatâ€™swrong	with	me.	I	just	know	that	thereâ€™s	something	between	us.	Thereâ€™s	areason	he	transferred	into	school	when	he	did.	And	he	told	Dad	[insertanecdote	here].	Why	canâ€™t	I	just	talk	to	him?	Iâ€™m	going	to	regret	it	if	Idonâ€™t.	This	shouldnâ€™t	be	so	hard.	But	it	is.Tomorrow	Iâ€™m	going	to	talk	to	John	Oâ€™Bleary.And	so	it	goes,	time	and	time	againâ€¦until:	You	know	that	dance	thatâ€™s	comingup?	The	Sadie	Hawkins	dance,	where	girls	are	supposed	to	ask	the	boys?	(As	ifyou	havenâ€™t	asked	your	date	to	every	other	dance,	you	inadvertent	feminist,you.)	Well,	youâ€™re	going	to	go	up	to	John	and	ask	him	to	go	to	the	dance	withyou.	Flat	out.	And	heâ€™s	going	to	say	that	someone	else	just	asked	himâ€”itâ€™s	agirl	youâ€™re	kind	of	friends	with,	and	one	of	the	only	popular	girls	whoâ€™s	neverpicked	on	you.	So	you	canâ€™t	even	hate	her.	Worse	still,	John	is	so	freaking	nicethat	he	asks	you	to	save	him	a	dance.You	never	do	get	that	dance.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	you	werenâ€™t	supposed	to.I	was	home	for	Christmas	in	2010,	sitting	on	the	sofa	at	Niniâ€™s	house	(yes,	westill	call	our	grandmother	Nini),	when	she	announced	that	John	Oâ€™Bleary	wasmarrying	that	very	same	girl	who	asked	him	to	the	dance	not	half	an	hourbefore	you	did.	And	in	that	moment,	I	couldnâ€™t	help	wondering	what	it	wouldhave	been	like	to	be	Mrs.	Oâ€™Bleary.Teen	Me,	donâ€™t	let	this	crush	you.	As	I	write	this	today,	I	canâ€™t	help	but	feellucky	that	Iâ€™m	not	Mrs.	Oâ€™Bleary.	Iâ€™m	in	love	right	now	with	someone	elseentirely,	hundreds	of	miles	from	chez	Oâ€™BlearyBut	even	knowing	that,	I	still	want	you	to	ask	John	to	that	dance.	You	wrote	inyour	secret	journal	that	you	didnâ€™t	want	to	be	thirty	and	look	back	with	regrets.You	were	sure	that	if	you	didnâ€™t	ask	John	out,	you	would	always	wonder,â€œWhat	if?â€	Iâ€™m	almost	thirty	now,	and	thanks	to	you,	I	have	no	what-ifs.	So,asking	John	out?	Yeah,	I	think	we	can	say	with	certainty	that	it	was	a	good	idea.(Even	though	the	journal	entry	from	that	evening	says	something	like:	Well,

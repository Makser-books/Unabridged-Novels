WANT.	TAKE.	HAVE.E.	Kristin	AndersonDear	Teen	Me,We	spend	most	mornings	writing	in	our	diary.	Not	the	fun	diary	that	you	sharewith	friends.	Not	the	one	where	you	draw	pictures	of	Hanson	and	Foo	Fightersand	analyze	the	Grammys.	Iâ€™m	talking	about	the	one	where	you	write	abouthow	scared	you	are	that	weâ€™ll	never	find	THE	ONE,	and	about	how	fightingwith	your	mom	is	wearing	you	out,	and	how	youâ€™re	grossed	out	by	sex,	andhow	desperately,	how	insanely	you	want	to	date	John	Oâ€™Bleary*.You	barely	know	John	Oâ€™Bleary.	He	transferred	to	your	school	duringsophomore	year,	and	now	heâ€™s	the	goalie	for	the	hockey	team.	The	team	yourbrother	plays	for.	The	team	your	dad	coaches.	And,	yes,	your	dad	actually	toldhis	players	that	if	they	tried	to	date	you	theyâ€™d	be	â€œriding	the	pine	ponyâ€indefinitely.But	Dad	would	have	made	an	exception	for	John.	Heâ€™s	different	from	the	otherhockey	guys.	And	sometimes	he	and	Dad	talk	about	you	on	the	team	bus.	Sonow	youâ€™re	convinced	that	you	and	John	Oâ€™Bleary	are	going	to	ride	off	into	thesunset	in	whatever	car	he	drives	(like	I	said,	you	barely	know	him)	and	getmarried	and	have	adorable	Oâ€™Bleary	babies.So	just	about	every	entry	in	your	journal	is	about	John	Oâ€™Bleary.	I	mean,	youâ€™reprobably	writing	about	him	right	now,	as	the	sun	finishes	coming	up.	I	betthereâ€™s	a	cup	of	Raspberry	Zinger	herbal	tea	cooling	on	your	nightstand	next	toa	half-eaten	bagel	slathered	in	cream	cheese.	You	have	a	whole	routine:	wakeup,	shower,	make	breakfast,	crawl	back	into	bed	(with	your	breakfast),	andwrite	in	your	diary.	Donâ€™t	even	try	to	deny	it.	Youâ€™re	about	to	start	anotherentry	about	how	today	is	the	day	youâ€™re	going	to	talk	to	John.In	fact,	there	are	eleventy	billion	entries	of	pure	Oâ€™Bleary	pining.	I	couldtranscribe	a	page	word	for	word,	but	Iâ€™d	hate	to	betray	your	confidence.	Afterall,	we	swore	to	ourselves	we	would	never	share	THAT	journal	with	anyone;we	fear	the	damage	its	publication	could	wreak	upon	our	impending	fame.	(Wedonâ€™t	want	our	adoring	public	to	know	that	weâ€™re	so	shallow	we	only	ever	write

THEREâ€™S	NO	SUCH	THING	AS	IMPOSSIBLERiley	CarneyDear	Teen	Me,You	know	that	dream	youâ€™ve	always	had?	The	one	about	becoming	an	author?Iâ€™ll	let	you	in	on	a	secret:	It	does	happen.	You	make	it	happen.But	itâ€™s	not	going	to	be	easy.	Youâ€™re	still	stuck	in	high	school	right	now.	Iremember	what	it	was	like,	and	I	know	exactly	how	you	feelâ€”it	seems	like	thewhole	thing	is	one	big	game;	that	youâ€™ll	never	find	your	place;	that	youâ€™ll	neverget	away	from	the	drama.Like	with	your	â€œbestâ€	friend.	You	helped	her	with	her	homework,	you	werenice	to	her,	and	you	provided	an	easy	boost	to	her	self-esteem.	She	never	reallycared	about	you,	though.	Once,	she	even	handed	out	Christmas	presents	in	frontof	you	and	conveniently	forgot	to	give	you	one.	And	I	also	remember	what	itwas	like	on	that	school	trip	where	you	had	to	sleep	in	the	top	bunk	abovefeuding	friends	who	were	crying	hysterically.	The	drama	is	everywhere,	and	nomatter	how	hard	you	try	to	avoid	it,	you	canâ€™t	seem	to	get	away.Youâ€™re	getting	tired	of	eating	lunch	alone	in	the	library	just	so	you	donâ€™t	haveto	wander	through	the	rows	of	tables	at	the	cafeteria	until	you	find	a	place	to	sit.Youâ€™re	tired	of	people	who	just	want	to	use	you	for	homework	help.	Youâ€™retired	of	the	box	that	has	been	built	up	around	you,	tired	of	the	walls	that	keepyou	trapped,	that	keep	you	from	becoming	the	person	who	you	really	are	inside,rather	than	the	person	who	everyone	thinks	you	are.But	in	less	than	a	year,	everything	will	change.	Youâ€™ll	find	a	way	to	break	freeof	that	box	by	doing	something	youâ€™ve	always	loved.	Writing	will	be	youroutlet.	Youâ€™re	going	to	write	a	bookâ€”a	book	that	youâ€™ve	been	dreaming	aboutfor	years.	You	are	going	to	pour	your	heart	and	soul	into	that	book,	and	itâ€™sgoing	to	be	published.	Over	the	next	three	years,	youâ€™ll	speak	at	schools	all	overthe	country,	something	you	never	thought	you	would	have	the	courage	to	do.But	thereâ€™s	something	you	have	to	realize	before	you	can	break	free:	The	boxthat	youâ€™re	in	is	only	as	strong	and	only	as	real	as	you	believe	it	to	be.

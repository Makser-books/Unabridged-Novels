Youâ€™re	not	weak.Youâ€™re	a	chick	with	some	messed	up	brain	chemistry,	and	youâ€™re	crying	in	theparking	lot	afraid	to	take	meds	because	you	think	you	wonâ€™t	be	able	to	writeanymore	if	things	donâ€™t	hurt	this	much.About	six	months	ago	you	wrote	that	book	about	the	kid	who	wants	to	break	allhis	bones	(and	in	about	a	year	and	a	half	people	are	going	to	start	asking	you,â€œHow	do	you	know	so	much	about	self-injury?â€	and	youâ€™re	going	to	smile	andtalk	around	the	question).	A	few	days	from	now,	youâ€™re	going	to	be	standing	onthe	sidewalk	outside	your	therapistâ€™s	office	when	your	agent	calls	and	tells	youthat	youâ€™re	going	on	submission,	but	sheâ€™s	going	to	tell	the	publishers	youâ€™reseventeen,	okay,	because	no	one	wants	to	work	with	a	sixteen-year-old,	andGod,	can	you	understand,	because	you	have	to	live	with	a	sixteen-year-old	andyou	have	to	watch	your	parents	try	to	live	with	a	sixteen-year-old	and	youâ€™d	getout	of	all	of	that	somehow	if	you	knew	how.	(You	donâ€™t	get	out.	You	stay.	Andthank	you	for	that,	Hannah.	Thank	you	for	that	every	single	day.)Your	therapist	asks	questions	you	donâ€™t	know	how	to	answer.	You	think	maybeturning	seventeen	will	help,	and	then	you	turn	seventeen	and	it	gets	worse	andjunior	year	slips	through	your	fingers.	You	sleep	through	prom	and	your	bestfriendâ€™s	graduation.	You	get	your	lowest	GPA	ever.	Itâ€™s	unacceptable,	becauseif	you	donâ€™t	get	into	Brown,	you	donâ€™t	know	what	youâ€™ll	do.(You	get	into	Brown.	After	the	first	month,	youâ€™re	ready	to	get	the	hell	out	ofthere.	You	transfer	home	to	the	huge	state	school	you	refused	to	ever	apply	to.Itâ€™s	incredible.)Look.Itâ€™s	not	normal.Youâ€™re	not	normal.And	I	know	that	if	I	were	there	really	sitting	in	the	car	next	to	you,	and	youheard	these	wordsâ€”words	that	everyone	else	in	the	world	would	probably	thinkare	horribleâ€”you	would	latch	onto	them.

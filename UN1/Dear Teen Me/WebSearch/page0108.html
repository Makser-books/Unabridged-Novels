THE	RAMIFICATIONS	OF	MOUTHING	OFFTO	CUTE	BOYSNikki	LoftinDear	Teen	Me,I	wish	I	could	stop	you.I	wish	I	could	stop	you	from	even	sitting	on	that	tree	swing	with	your	First	RealHigh	School	Boyfriend	(heâ€™s	a	sophomore	and	youâ€™re	just	a	freshman!),	BillUnderhill.*	Because	I	see	where	this	is	going.	And	I	really	wish	I	could	stopyou	from	leaning	in	for	that	first	kiss.	(That	atrocious,	saliva-soaked,	tongue-so-far-down-your-throat-you-gag-and-almost-throw-up-Lucky-Charms,	 poorlyexecuted	car	wash	of	a	French	kiss.)But	mostly?	I	wish	I	could	stop	you	from	saying	what	you	say	about	threekisses	later.When	you	askâ€”oh	Godâ€”if	he	wouldnâ€™t	mind	NEVER	kissing	you	like	thatagain?	Because	heâ€™s	a	great	boyfriend,	but	UGH!	THAT	WAS	SO	GROSS!You	know	whatâ€™s	next:	No	more	boyfriend.Youâ€™ve	pretty	much	always	come	right	out	and	said	what	you	thought,	withoutthinking	about	the	consequences.	There	are	lots	of	times	when	it	doesnâ€™t	turnout	all	that	great	(although	having	your	face	exfoliated	by	Billâ€™s	tongue	onemore	time	would	have	been	cause	for	homicide,	so	maybe	you	were	right	toinsult	the	guy),	but	that	runaway	mouth	of	yours	is	going	to	cause	real	pain	tofriends	and	family	members.	Enough	pain	that	I	really,	really	wish	I	could	getyou	to	listen	to	this	one	piece	of	advice:	Whether	you	intend	to	compliment	orinsult,	think,	for	just	a	second,	before	you	speak.Itâ€™s	probably	hopeless.	Still,	donâ€™t	despair.	Your	tendency	to	blabâ€™s	going	to	dosome	good,	too.For	instance,	in	a	month,	your	friends	will	start	telling	you	how	much	thecute/popular	Ray	Vargas	likes	you.

who	you	are	inside.Eventually,	you	find	forever	connection	with	an	amazing	man.	One	whoembraces	you,	and	the	responsibilities	of	a	ready-made	family.	Yes,	youâ€™ll	havethree	children,	one	of	whom	will	be	responsible	for	an	earthquake	of	pain.	Butyouâ€™ll	survive	this	heartbreak,	too,	and	not	only	does	it	make	you	stronger,	itputs	you	on	the	path	you	donâ€™t	yet	know	youâ€™re	searching	for.	(Iâ€™ll	give	you	ahint:	Keep	writing	poetry.)	You	will	parent	a	fourth	child,	too.	Full	circle,youâ€™ll	adopt	him	when	you	are	forty-two,	the	exact	same	age	your	mother	waswhen	she	adopted	you.	And,	full	circle,	he	will	be	bullied	and	struggle	withfeeling	different.	Being	adopted	has	that	effect.	But	youâ€™ve	been	there,	andrecognize	the	emotions	he	experiences.	You	will	help	him	grow	into	a	brilliantyoung	man,	in	part	because	of	the	things	you	have	been	through	yourself.	Yourpast	helps	create	his	future.What	I	wish	you	could	understand,	teen	me,	is	that	the	past	does	create	thefuture.	Everything	that	sets	you	apart	also	makes	you	unique.	You	are	finding	adistinctive	voice,	and	one	day	that	voice	will	speak	not	only	to	many,	but	alsofor	many	who	canâ€™t	speak	for	themselves.	All	that	rejection	helps	you	grow	athick	skin,	one	youâ€™ll	need	when	you	finally	settle	into	the	career	you	weredestined	for.	Being	pushed	away	makes	you	want	to	gather	others	in.	And	youwill,	in	ways	small	and	immense.Of	course,	if	you	suspected	any	of	this	now,	you	might	just	crawl	into	yourcloset	and	stay	there,	where	itâ€™s	private.	Cozy.	Safe.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	Lifeisnâ€™t	always	safe.	It	isnâ€™t	always	happy	or	pretty	or	neat.	Sometimes	itâ€™sdownright	sad	and	ugly	and	messy.	Dangerous,	even.	You	have	to	take	risks	todiscover	courage.	You	must	know	pain	to	understand	the	true	meaning	of	joy.And	only	through	experiencing	the	sting	of	death	will	you	come	to	cherishliving.You	will	make	mistakes.	Everyone	does.	Accept	thatâ€”no,	value	thatâ€”andkeep	moving	forward.	I	promise,	in	the	future	youâ€™ll	look	back	and	decide	youwouldnâ€™t	change	a	thing.	Each	misstep,	each	sidestep,	each	baby	step	bringsyou	one	step	closer	to	where	you	belong,	and	once	you	reach	this	place,	everyday	will	bring	immense	satisfaction.Dearest	Teen	Ellen.	You	were	unusual	from	the	start.	Each	inimitable	day	ofyour	life	helps	create	a	voice	completely	your	own.

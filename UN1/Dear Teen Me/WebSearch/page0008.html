stamp	an	R	on	my	forehead	and	throw	me	in	the	Reject	bin!)Youâ€™re	not	a	reject,	Teen	Me.	Youâ€™re	brave.	When	you	think	back	on	thatmoment	later	on,	youâ€™ll	feel	pride,	more	than	anything	else:	pride,	becauseyouâ€™re	the	kind	of	girl	who	has	the	cojones	to	ask	for	what	she	wants.Youâ€™re	setting	a	high	standard	for	yourself	as	an	adult.	For	me.	You	alreadyknow	what	you	want	and	you	ask	for	it	without	hesitation.	Okay,	maybe	with	alittle	hesitationâ€”the	journal	proves	thatâ€”but	I	love	that	you	dare	not	only	todream,	but	to	believe	in	those	dreams,	whatever	the	cost.	I	mean,	it	will	beabout	three	years	before	you	realize	that	youâ€™re	not	going	to	be	a	rock	star	inthis	lifetime,	but	youâ€™re	never,	ever	going	to	be	afraid	to	(poorly)	sing	karaoke.And	sure,	youâ€™re	not	poet	laureate	(yet),	but	youâ€™re	going	to	publish	a	lot	ofgreat	poems	in	actual	magazines	because	you	will	actually	put	those	poems	inthe	mail	and	send	them	out	into	the	world.	And	no	matter	how	many	times	youget	your	heart	broken,	youâ€™ll	keep	on	believing	in	love.Asking	John	Oâ€™Bleary	to	the	Sadie	Hawkins	dance	was	about	so	much	morethan	getting	rejected	by	the	boy	of	your	dreams;	it	was	about	setting	the	pacefor	the	rest	of	your	life.	You	already	believe	in	something	Faith	will	say	onBuffy	the	Vampire	Slayer:	â€œWant,	take,	have!â€	And	while	youâ€™re	not	going	touse	this	for	evil	quite	the	way	she	did,	youâ€™re	going	to	wear	your	heart	on	yoursleeve	and	pursue	impossible	goals	and	take	inadvisable	risks.	Because	itâ€™s	theonly	way	you	know	how	to	be	you.But	I	think	youâ€™ve	already	got	a	sense	of	thisâ€”even	on	bad	days,	when	you	feellike	you	have	eighty	Râ€™s	on	your	forehead	(like	the	day	when	you	realize	that,whoa,	thereâ€™s	no	cure	for	bipolar	disorder;	or	all	the	times	when	you	want	tohide	until	school,	and	your	parents,	and	the	mean	girls	disappear).	Pretty	soonyouâ€™re	going	to	realize	that	â€œIt	works	if	you	work	itâ€	is	more	than	a	TaylorHawkins	quote	(from	that	new	magazine	Nylon).	â€œIt	works	if	you	work	itâ€	arewords	to	live	by,	and	youâ€™re	already	on	top	of	it.	So	donâ€™t	change	a	damn	thing.*Name	not-so-elusively	changed	to	protect	the	bashful.E.	Kristin	Anderson	has	a	fancy	diploma	that	says	â€œB.A.	in	Classics,â€	whichmakes	her	sound	smart	but	hasnâ€™t	helped	her	get	any	jobs	in	ancient	Rome.

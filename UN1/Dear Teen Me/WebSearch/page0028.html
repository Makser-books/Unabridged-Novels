DANCE	DANCE	REVOLUTIONMarke	BieschkeDear	Teen	Me,Youâ€™ve	just	turned	sixteen,	and	pretty	soon,	on	a	random	Saturday	night,	youâ€™regoing	to	roll	your	momâ€™s	car	out	of	the	garage,	start	it	up	down	the	street,	andsneak	off	to	a	tiny	downtown	Detroit	nightclub.	That	night	is	going	to	changeyour	life.	And	no,	itâ€™s	not	because	on	your	way	back	you	make	an	illegal	left-hand	turn	into	the	police	chiefâ€™s	personal	car	and	get	totally	busted	for	takingthe	car	without	permissionâ€”although	that	certainly	throws	a	monkey	wrenchinto	your	summer	plans.But	that	night,	with	two	misfit	friends	at	your	side,	you	discover	anunderground	world	where	youâ€™re	accepted	for	the	fantastic	little	freak	that	youareâ€”a	world	that	expresses	itself	though	music,	fashion,	and	dance	like	youâ€™venever	heard	or	seen	before.	Itâ€™s	full	of	outrageous	and	outspoken	weirdos	wholove	art	and	books	as	much	as	you	do,	and	who	want	to	hear	what	you	actuallythink	about	things.	This	world	is	completely	opposed	to	your	everyday	highschool	reality,	where	people	beat	you	up	because	you	dye	your	hair	and	listen	tobands	from	England.Youâ€™ll	end	up	sneaking	out	again	and	again,	of	course.	Youâ€™ll	spend	your	daysfantasizing	about	the	next	club	night,	figuring	out	what	youâ€™re	going	to	wear,what	youâ€™re	going	to	say,	and	how	youâ€™re	going	to	danceâ€”not	to	mention	howyouâ€™re	going	to	get	there.	Youâ€™ve	finally	found	a	place	where	you	belong!	(Andwhere	youâ€™re	not	the	only	one	whoâ€™s	gay.)	You	treasure	every	second	in	thisworld,	and	eventually	it	wonâ€™t	just	be	your	passion;	it	will	be	your	career.Looking	back,	however,	you	realize	something	else:	Taking	the	car	and	gettingcaught	were	part	of	a	pattern	of	behavior	that	was	more	or	less	directly	tied	toyour	fatherâ€™s	alcoholism.	You	had	no	clue	what	was	going	on	at	the	timeâ€”yourmotherâ€™s	largely	successful	attempts	to	hide	his	disease	will	implode	a	yearlater,	when	your	dad	shocks	you	and	your	sister	by	bravely	and	successfullychecking	into	rehab.	He	didnâ€™t	beat	you	or	anything,	and	you	were	alwaysprovided	for.	But	he	did	shut	you	out	in	weird	waysâ€”ways	that	made	you	feelyou	had	to	struggle	to	be	heard,	and	that	amplified	both	your	loneliness	and

GETTING	PAST	THE	FEARStasia	Ward	KehoeDear	Teen	Me,As	I	write	this	letter,	you	have	kids	of	your	own.	I	know,	right	now	youâ€™retelling	everyone	that	youâ€™re	an	artist,	swearing	that	youâ€™ll	never	marry	or	havechildren.	But	thereâ€™ll	be	a	guy	who	changes	that	plan.	Meanwhile,	youâ€™ll	buryyourself	in	dance	and	theater,	pretending	youâ€™re	too	busy	for	boys.	Really,youâ€™re	afraid	of	them.	In	fact,	youâ€™re	afraid	of	so	many	things	that	I	sometimeswonder	how	you	let	your	friend	Aimee	drag	you	to	that	frat	party.	Itâ€™s	probablybecause	you	were	afraid	to	lose	Aimee,	whoâ€™s	one	of	your	few	reliable	friends.So	now	youâ€™re	standing	by	the	living	room	fireplace	on	Greek	Row.	The	musicpounds	through	the	floorboards,	and	then	up	your	legs	and	into	your	franticheart.	Even	if	Aimee	hadnâ€™t	disappeared	into	the	crowd,	there	would	still	be	noway	for	you	to	talk	to	anyone	here.	You	stand	still,	afraid	to	even	sip	the	punch(which	smells	more	like	acne	medicine	than	fruit	juice).Youâ€™re	about	to	go	sit	out	the	rest	of	this	miserable	night	on	the	front	porchwhen	Joe,	the	boy	Aimee	had	come	to	flirt	with,	approaches	you.	He	leans	hisarm	against	the	chimney,	shielding	you	from	the	frenzy.	He	says	somethingabout	getting	away	from	the	chaos.	You	nod	because	you	donâ€™t	like	crowdseither,	and	Joe	invites	you	to	his	room.You	want	to	get	away	from	the	party	so	badly	that	you	actually	think	Joeâ€™sbedroom	is	preferable	to	the	front	stoop.	And	you	justify	your	lapse	in	judgmentby	blaming	Aimee	for	ditching	you	first.	What	you	donâ€™t	see	now	is	that	yourbiggest	fearâ€”even	worse	than	boysâ€”is	of	being	lonely.With	barely	a	word,	Joe	leads	you	past	the	desk	to	his	bed,	directing	you	ontoyour	back	by	pointing	out	the	glow-in-the-dark	stars	on	the	ceiling.	In	the	dim,quiet	room,	he	starts	kissing	you.	He	tugs	your	tank	top	down,	staring,	whileyou	feel	about	as	romanced	as	a	frog	on	a	dissecting	table.	When	Joe	gets	up,muttering,	â€œIâ€™ll	be	right	back,â€	your	brain	finally	kicks	into	gear.	You	fix	yourshirt,	find	the	door,	and	run	straight	to	Aimeeâ€™s	car.	Youâ€™re	still	there,shivering,	when	she	turns	up	an	hour	later,	saying	that	she	never	found	Joe.

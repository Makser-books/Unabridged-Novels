embarrassed	you	ripped	up	those	once-precious	drawings	and	threw	them	awayin	tears.	You	never	picked	up	a	pencil	again.You	let	Alex	A.	take	something	important	from	you.	Something	that	mattered.Something	that	gave	you	comfort	and	hope.	Today	I	canâ€™t	draw	to	save	my	life.Alex	stole	that	from	me.	From	you.	From	us.I	donâ€™t	know	why	Alex	A.	targeted	you	back	then.	Maybe	he	was	feeling	badabout	himself	and	needed	to	rip	into	someone	else	to	save	his	own	self-esteem.Or	maybe	he	sensed	a	sweet,	sensitive	soul	who	would	take	his	cruelty	to	heart,giving	him	power	for	the	first	time	in	his	life.	But	in	the	end,	it	doesnâ€™t	matterwhy.	He	hurt	you,	and	the	experience	didnâ€™t	make	you	any	stronger.	It	didnâ€™tmake	you	a	better	person.	Anyone	who	says	bullying	builds	character	can	suckit.But	donâ€™t	worry.	In	the	end,	you	grow	up	to	write	a	novel	about	bullying.	Youdig	deep	into	your	own	psyche	and	fictionalize	the	pain	you	once	experiencedfor	real.	And	the	best	part?	You	give	your	heroine	a	happy	ending.	The	kindyou	didnâ€™t	get	in	real	life.	She	rises	above	her	haters.	She	doesnâ€™t	let	them	robher	of	her	passion	for	art.And	the	book	winds	up	inspiring	tons	of	teenage	girls!	Girls	currently	in	juniorhigh	(and	who	are	facing	their	own	Alexes	on	a	daily	basis)	take	the	time	towrite	you	e-mails	telling	you	how	your	characterâ€™s	courage	has	helped	themfind	some	courage	of	their	own.So	now	that	I	think	of	it,	maybe	you	did	get	your	happy	ending	after	all.	Whilethat	little	bully,	Alex	A.,	is	busy	trying	to	outwit	(or	outrun)	a	thousand-poundlizard.Emmy	Awardâ€“winner	Mari	Mancusi	works	as	a	freelance	TV	producer	and	isthe	author	of	books	for	teens,	including	the	Blood	Coven	Vampire	series	andGamer	Girl	(2008).

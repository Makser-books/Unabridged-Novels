REGARDING	YOUR	COMMENDABLEDECISION	TO	LIVEMike	JungDear	Teen	Me,Itâ€™s	good	that	Iâ€™m	sending	you	a	letter	from	here	in	the	future,	because	I	knowitâ€™s	not	likely	youâ€™d	trust	me	if	I	tried	to	talk	to	you	in	person.	You	donâ€™t	trustmany	people,	and	honestly,	why	would	you?	Youâ€™re	fifteen,	and	fifteen,	foryou,	was	a	monstrously	bad	year.	Right	now	you	canâ€™t	even	remember	a	timewhen	your	life	wasnâ€™t	all	about	bullies,	bullies,	bulliesâ€”theyâ€™ve	verbally	laidinto	you	every	day	for	the	past	four	years,	and	itâ€™s	gotten	physical	more	than	afew	times	as	well.	Thatâ€™s	approximately	a	thousand	days	of	hearing	all	thereasons	why	youâ€™re	such	a	catastrophic	loser:	your	face,	clothes,	skin,	hair,	lackof	athletic	ability,	fondness	for	role-playing	games,	awkwardness	with	girls,bookworm	tendencies,	and	ethnicity	are	all	fair	game.Itâ€™s	also	clear	that	no	help	is	forthcoming.	For	example,	there	was	that	teacherwho	stood	and	watched	through	the	locker	room	window	as	a	cluster	of	biggerguys	pushed	you	into	a	corner	locker	and	showered	you	with	racist,homophobic	taunts,	preventing	you	from	getting	dressed	until	the	room	wasemptied	out.	And	the	fact	that	youâ€™re	at	least	a	year	younger	than	everyone	elsein	the	room	doesnâ€™t	make	things	any	easierâ€”your	suspicion	that	your	parentswere	wrong	about	moving	you	up	a	grade	is	192	percent	confirmed.Yep,	good	times.	There	are	two	years	of	high	school	left	to	goâ€”youâ€™re	lookingat	another	500	days	of	similar	treatmentâ€”but	the	damage	has	already	beendone.	The	bullies	and	critics	have	convinced	you	that	theyâ€™re	right.	You	despiseyourself.Iâ€™m	genuinely	sorry.	Youâ€™re	in	emotional	agony,	you	feel	desperately	alone,and	you	canâ€™t	engage	with	the	good	things	and	amazing	people	that	are	actuallythere	for	you.	In	fact,	fifteen	is	the	age	when	you	first	truly	consider	the	mostextreme	way	out.	Anger	and	bitternessâ€”at	your	so-called	peers,	at	your	family,at	the	entire,	unfeeling	universeâ€”nearly	consume	you,	and	in	the	years	to	comeyouâ€™ll	spend	more	than	one	sleepless	night	deciding	whether	or	not	to	go	on

To	unravel	the	mystery	of	why	good	music	always	makes	you	cry.But	thatâ€™s	for	the	future,	maybe.	Tonight,	youâ€™re	just	happy	to	be	there.Sometime	after	the	first	set,	the	stadium	doors	open,	and	security	calls	youforth,	ushering	in	the	poor,	ticketless	masses	for	a	chance	to	see	the	stage.	TheDead,	it	turns	out,	welcome	all.	Youâ€™re	entranced.	When	you	reach	the	top	ofthe	stairs	and	step	out	into	the	stands,	your	heart	flutters.	Jerryâ€™s	leading	theband	in	this	crazy	jam,	part	jazz	riff,	part	folksy	drum	trip.	There	are	no	words,just	rich	music,	and	everyone	in	the	packed	stadium	sways	and	spins,	handsfloating	up	like	little	birds.	Colored	lights	illuminate	the	stage,	and	thoughyouâ€™re	way	up	high,	the	energy	reaches	you	and	fills	you	with	an	inexplicablehuman	connectedness	the	likes	of	which	youâ€™ll	never	again	feel.	Soon,	yourhands	float	up	like	the	rest,	and	you	dance.At	the	end	of	the	show,	you	drift	on	the	current	of	the	crowd,	flowing	outsidelike	water.	You	donâ€™t	speak,	but	you	look	at	your	best	friend	and	smile,	eyesshining.	Itâ€™s	that	kind	of	night,	and	you	drop	your	last	fifteen	bucks	on	a	T-shirtto	commemorate	it.	â€œToke	up,	Doc,â€	it	says	under	a	red-eyed	Bugs	Bunnydoing	just	that.(FYI,	the	shirt	isnâ€™t	exactly	a	crowd-pleaser	with	school	officials	that	Monday,or	with	your	parents,	but	thatâ€™s	a	story	for	another	letter.)You	and	Melissa	are	so	enraptured	that	you	donâ€™t	immediately	notice	the	coplooking	out	across	the	field,	standing	in	the	empty	spot	where	Melissaâ€™s	carought	to	be.	The	illegally	parked	vehicles	have	been	impounded,	he	announces.You	can	reclaim	them	at	the	station	for	a	fee	of	one	hundred	and	eighty-fivedollars.You	look	at	the	shirt	in	your	hands.Thatâ€™s	all,	folks.Youâ€™re	stranded.You	could	take	your	chances	at	Camp	Deadhead,	you	think.	Put	that	fantasy	inmotion,	find	a	nice	dreadlocked	family	and	share	their	wool	blankets	until	itâ€™stime	to	shove	off	at	dawnâ€¦.No.	Look	around.	Take	a	deep	breath	of	tea-scented	air	and	assess	the	situation.Thereâ€™s	trash	everywhere,	cans	and	bottles	overflowing	from	barrels,	dottingthe	grass	like	aluminum	flowers.Five-cent-deposit-earning	aluminum	flowers.

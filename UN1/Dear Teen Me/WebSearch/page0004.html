Dear	Readers,It	started	with	Hanson.	Yesâ€”that	band	from	the	90â€™s	with	the	three	blondbrothers	and	the	hit	single	â€œMMMBop.â€	You	can	giggle	all	you	want,	but	theywere	Emilyâ€™s	obsession	as	a	teen.	Other	kids	picked	on	her	for	loving	them,	butshe	tried	not	to	care,	and	only	blushed	a	little	when	her	classmates	asked	aboutthe	portrait	of	Taylor	Hanson	that	she	was	working	on	that	one	day	in	art	class.Growing	up	in	Maine,	Emily	missed	out	on	the	opportunity	to	see	Hanson	live.(They	didnâ€™t	tour	up	there	until	after	sheâ€™d	moved	away.)	But	at	27,	Emily	sawthem	for	the	first	time.	All	grown	up,	they	rocked	hard	on	the	stage	at	Antoneâ€™s.It	was	such	a	rush.	On	the	way	out	the	door,	elated	to	the	point	of	slurredspeech,	Emily	knew	she	had	to	tell	her	teen	self	about	it.	So	she	did.	In	a	verylong	post	on	her	blog.For	her	part,	Miranda	would	talk	about	Star	Trek	with	anybody	who	wouldlisten	when	she	was	a	kid.	Unfortunately,	none	of	her	friends	liked	it.	Theyconsidered	Star	Trek	dorky,	and	this	destroyed	her	self-esteem.	It	wasnâ€™t	untilcollege	that	Miranda	found	other	people	who	also	loved	Star	Trek.	How	muchwould	teen	Miranda	have	loved	to	know	that	there	were	other	people	out	there	â€“great	people!	â€“	who	actually	shared	her	interests?The	internet	didnâ€™t	exist	back	thenâ€”or	at	least,	not	like	it	does	now.	Now,	kidseverywhere	can	find	friends	online	who	share	similar	interests.	(This	is	how	wefound	each	other.)	When	we	started	putting	together	Dear	Teen	Me,	we	wantedit	to	be	a	place	for	authors	to	share	experiences	with	teens,	so	that	teens	wouldknow	they	are	not	alone	and	that	they	are	cared	for,	and	that	there	are	adultswho	remember	what	itâ€™s	like	to	be	a	teen.We	began	posting	letters	on	December	1,	2010,	and	almost	immediately,	thesite	blew	up.	Or,	at	least,	we	felt	like	it	didâ€”the	response	was	beyond	ourwildest	expectations.	We	received	messages	from	so	many	authors	who	wantedto	write	letters	to	their	teen	selves,	to	give	hope	and	advice	and	direction	basedon	what	they	knew	now.	And,	even	more	importantly,	readers	were	joining	thechorus,	saying	â€œme	too!â€	and	â€œthanks	for	sharing!â€	and	â€œyou	make	me	feel	lessalone.â€	We	laughed,	we	cried,	and	we	hugged	(if	only	virtually)	every	step	ofthe	way.	In	2011,	we	met	the	incredible	folks	at	Zest	who	said,	hey,	letâ€™s	makea	book	out	of	this	thing.	This	is	that	book.This	book	is	for	you.	For	the	loners,	the	stoners,	the	freaks	and	the	geeks,	thehead	cheerleaders	and	the	kids	eating	lunch	in	the	library,	the	starting	lineup,the	benchwarmers,	the	glee	club,	and	the	marching	band.	This	book	is	for

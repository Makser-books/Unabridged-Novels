JUST	BE	YOURSELF!Stephanie	PellegrinDear	Teen	Me,Psst!	Hey!	You	in	the	corner	of	the	library	with	your	nose	stuck	in	a	book.	Yes,you.	Donâ€™t	recognize	me	without	that	awful	perm,	do	you?	(Remind	me	againwhy	you	thought	that	was	a	good	idea?)Anyway,	I	hope	you	donâ€™t	mind	if	I	sit	with	you	for	a	minute,	but	we	need	totalk.	Donâ€™t	worry	about	the	â€œno	talking	in	the	libraryâ€	rule.	Iâ€™m	sure	weâ€™ll	befine.	Librarians	arenâ€™t	as	bad	as	they	seem.Judging	from	the	hair	and	braces	Iâ€™d	have	to	guess	youâ€™re	in	your	junior	year.Yes?	Thought	so.	Iâ€™d	forgotten	how	many	lonely	lunch	hours	you	spent	in	theschool	library.	You	have	some	friends	in	the	cafeteria	that	you	could	sit	with,but	you	donâ€™t	feel	like	you	really	fit	in,	do	you?	Thatâ€™s	why	you	joined	everyschool	club	you	could.	I	just	counted	and	youâ€™re	in	eighteen,	not	to	mention	thenumerous	after-school	activities	youâ€™re	involved	in.	I	mean	honestly,	you	joinedthe	ROTC.	You	donâ€™t	even	like	ROTC!	And	I	wonâ€™t	even	bother	bringing	upthat	time	you	tried	ballet.	Iâ€™m	still	having	nightmares	about	the	fifth	position!Let	me	ask	you,	howâ€™s	it	all	working	out?	Not	very	well,	am	I	right?	Byspending	so	much	time	trying	to	find	yourself,	youâ€™re	slowly	losing	yourself.We	donâ€™t	all	have	one	single	rock-star	talent,	and	honestly,	I	think	those	of	uswho	donâ€™t	are	the	lucky	ones.	Life	isnâ€™t	about	finding	the	one	thing	youâ€™re	goodat	and	never	doing	anything	else;	itâ€™s	about	exploring	yourself	and	finding	outwho	you	really	are	on	your	own	terms	and	in	your	own	way.	You	donâ€™t	have	toexhaust	yourself	to	do	that.Oh,	donâ€™t	be	so	down	in	the	dumps	about	it.	Youâ€™ll	eventually	find	somethingyouâ€™re	good	at,	I	promise.	Itâ€™s	a	long,	winding	road	to	get	there,	but	youâ€™ll	findit.	Being	able	to	spend	all	day	doing	what	you	love	(or	one	of	the	things	thatyou	love)	is	the	most	amazing	feeling	in	the	world.	And	no,	I	wonâ€™t	tell	youwhat	it	is,	so	donâ€™t	even	ask	me.	Just	remember	to	always	be	yourself,	becausethereâ€™s	nobody	else	who	can	do	it	for	you.	I	think	E.	E.	Cummings	put	it	bestwhen	he	said,	â€œIt	takes	courage	to	grow	up	and	become	who	you	really	are.â€

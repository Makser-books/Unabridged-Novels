too.	Especially	after	mom	and	dad	got	divorced.	You	want	to	be	liked	by	yourpeers.	You	want	to	be	looked	up	to,	held	in	high	esteem.	But	the	most	importantman	in	your	lifeâ€”our	dad!â€”dragged	your	self-esteem	through	the	mud.	Hedidnâ€™t	accept	you	as	the	artist	you	were.	He	wanted	a	sports	star.	He	didnâ€™t	likeyour	brown	skin.	He	wanted	a	light-skinned	kid	with	straight	hair.	He	drank	alot	and	said	a	lot	of	really	mean	things.	I	get	that.	I	understand.But	thereâ€™s	something	else	you	need	to	understand	:	Your	mom,	she	loves	you.Your	grandma	and	grandpa	do,	too.	Your	three	little	brothers	all	look	up	to	youand	love	you.	In	factâ€”and	youâ€™ll	find	this	hard	to	believeâ€”your	dad,	he	lovesyou	too.	He	just	doesnâ€™t	know	how	to	show	it,	because	he	didnâ€™t	have	a	verygood	dad	himself.Being	a	man	is	not	about	how	many	pairs	of	jeans	you	can	steal.	Itâ€™s	not	aboutwhether	or	not	you	can	blow	smoke	rings.	And	itâ€™s	not	about	making	babieseither.	(Any	dog,	cat,	or	snake	can	do	that.)Prove	greatness	through	what	you	are	truly	good	at:	creating	art.	Not	machismo.Take	advantage	of	whatâ€™s	already	within	you:	raw,	freaking,	God-given	talent.Thatâ€™s	how	to	be	a	big	man.Don	Tate	has	illustrated	numerous	critically	acclaimed	booksfor	children	including	Ronâ€™s	Big	Mission	(2009),	She	LovedBaseball	(2010),	and	Duke	Ellingtonâ€™s	Nutcracker	Suite	(2011).Don	is	also	the	author	of	the	book	It	Jesâ€™	Happened:	When	BillTraylor	Started	to	Draw	(2012).	His	illustrations	appearregularly	in	newspapers	and	magazines,	and	on	products	forchildren	such	as	wallpaper,	textiles,	calendars,	apparel,	andpaper	products.

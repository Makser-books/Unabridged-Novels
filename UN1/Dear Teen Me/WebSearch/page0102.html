your	face.	All	you	want	is	for	Charlie	to	call.	To	tell	you	that	he	was	wrong;that	he	likes	you,	not	her.	None	of	your	friends	will	listen	to	you	talk	aboutCharlie	anymore,	because	theyâ€™re	sick	to	death	of	your	obsession	with	him.	Youfeel	alone.The	phone	rings.	Itâ€™s	Jack.â€œHey,â€	he	says.	â€œWant	to	come	over	to	my	house	and	swim?	My	parents	arenâ€™tin	town.â€All	you	can	think	about	is	Charlie.	What	if	he	calls	while	youâ€™re	at	Jackâ€™shouse?	Cell	phones	arenâ€™t	really	mainstream	yet.	You	donâ€™t	have	a	pager.â€œI	canâ€™t,â€	you	tell	him.	â€œI	donâ€™t	feel	well.â€	Lie.â€œAw,	come	on.	Come	over.â€You	lie	there,	staring	across	the	room	at	the	pictures	of	you	and	Charlie	that	arepinned	all	over	your	bulletin	board.	You	think	about	peeling	off	a	T-shirt	andshorts	to	reveal	a	two-piece	bathing	suit	in	front	of	Jack.	It	never	has	fit	right.Youâ€™re	not	skinny	like	the	cheerleaders	he	hangs	out	with.	Does	he	want	to	kissyou?	What	if	he	tries?	No	oneâ€™s	ever	kissed	you	before.	What	if	youâ€™re	aterrible	kisser	because	youâ€™ve	never	had	any	practice?	Thereâ€™s	no	way	in	hell	aguy	like	him	would	kiss	me	anyway,	you	think.You	remember	all	the	guys	youâ€™ve	liked	over	the	years.	None	of	them	haveliked	you	back.	A	few	boys	have	liked	you,	but	you	werenâ€™t	interested	in	them.(You	never	gave	them	a	chance.	You	were	too	worried	that	people	would	makefun	of	you	for	hanging	around	â€œdorkyâ€	guys.)You	donâ€™t	bother	to	think	about	Jackâ€™s	feelings	because	you	assume	that	he,like	everyone	else	(yourself	excluded),	lives	a	golden	life.	What	if	Jack	needs	afriend?	What	if	heâ€™s	lonely	and	looking	for	something	and	wants	to	tell	youabout	it?	Did	you	ever	think	that	he	started	coming	to	church	because	you	askedhim	to?	Because	he	thought	you	cared	enough	about	him	to	include	him?Why	donâ€™t	you	ever	think	about	anyone	but	yourself,	Miranda?	What	if	Jackneeds	you?â€œI	canâ€™t	come	over.â€â€œOkay.	Well,	Iâ€™ll	talk	to	you	later,â€	Jack	replies,	and	hangs	up.Now,	over	ten	years	later,	I	can	tell	you.Jack	never	calls	you	again.

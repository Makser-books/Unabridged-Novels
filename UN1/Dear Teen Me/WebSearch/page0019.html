turn	out	to	be	two	of	your	best	friends,	and	youâ€™ll	find	yourselves	laughingand	reminiscing	about	that	experience	time	and	time	again.	Believe	it	ornot,	it	actually	becomes	a	funny	story.	And	while	you	survive	the	hotelexperience	intact,	youâ€™ll	never	find	that	one	sweater	again.6.	That	being	said,	before	you	go	on	vacation,	CHECK	TO	MAKE	SUREA	PIPE	HASNâ€™T	BURST	BEFORE	LEAVING	THE	HOUSE.SERIOUSLY.	GO	CHECK.7.	Six	weeks	after	you	turn	eighteen,	youâ€™ll	move	to	New	York	City	toattend	NYU	and	live	in	Greenwich	Village.	Sounds	awesome,	right?	Like	adream	come	true?	Well,	youâ€™ll	cry	like	a	baby	for	the	entire	first	week,	andthen	youâ€™ll	feel	so	homesick	that	youâ€™ll	construct	elaborate	fantasies	abouttaking	a	cab	to	the	airport	and	flying	home.	Donâ€™t.	Stay	for	at	least	twoyears.	Itâ€™s	good	for	you	to	be	in	a	new	city	with	new	people.	Youâ€™ll	learnhow	to	ride	the	subway	and	tell	the	difference	between	the	express	andlocal	trains.	And	after	eighteen	years	in	Orange	County,	California,	youâ€™llfinally	discover	what	â€œwinterâ€	really	means.	(Helpful	hint:	buy	a	sturdyumbrella,	but	donâ€™t	bother	with	a	hat.	You	look	ridiculous	in	hats.)	If	youleave	too	soon,	youâ€™ll	miss	walking	through	Washington	Square	Park	aftera	January	storm,	seeing	the	bare	trees	filled	with	flecks	of	icy	light,	andfeeling	the	contentment	that	comes	from	knowing	youâ€™re	exactly	where	youought	to	be.	Youâ€™ll	miss	that	exciting	night	at	the	diner	when,	for	reasonsthat	are	never	made	entirely	clear,	your	waiter	has	to	run	outside	to	punch	apasserby	while	you	huddle	with	the	rest	of	the	customers	in	the	back	of	therestaurant,	waiting	for	the	police	to	arrive.	(Now	that	is	a	story	for	anothertime.	But	donâ€™t	tell	Mom	about	it	until	youâ€™re	a	lot	older.	Sheâ€™ll	freak.)8.	Thereâ€™s	going	to	be	a	period	in	your	life	where	everything	goes	wrong.	Itjust	does.	Iâ€™m	sorry.	Your	grandparents	will	pass	away.	Your	dad	is	goingto	die.	Youâ€™ll	become	very	sick	and	have	to	quit	your	awesome	PR	job	atthe	bookstore.	Youâ€™ll	also	get	rejected	from	all	your	MFA	programs	on	thesame	day.	I	canâ€™t	sugarcoat	it;	itâ€™s	just	going	to	suck.	Youâ€™ll	cry	a	lot,	andwhen	you	start	working	again	youâ€™ll	think	that	youâ€™ve	screwed	everythingup,	that	everything	you	want	to	achieve	will	never	happen.	Youâ€™ll	beashamed	of	your	life.Please,	donâ€™t	worry.	You	worry	enough	as	it	is.	All	these	seemingly	wrongturns	are	actually	leading	you	in	the	right	direction.	All	those	things	youwant	to	achieve	are	just	ahead	of	you,	so	donâ€™t	you	dare	stop	reaching	forthem.	Theyâ€™re	closer	than	you	realize,	and	if	you	stop,	if	you	give	up	andgive	in,	then	all	that	struggle	will	have	been	wasted.9.	Youâ€™re	going	to	write	the	following	in	your	journal	on	January	23,	1996:

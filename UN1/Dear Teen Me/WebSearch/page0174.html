FINDING	HIMJessica	SpotswoodDear	Teen	Me,You	are	a	truly	whimsical	being.	You	wish	upon	a	star	every	Christmas	Eve(and	on	fireworks	during	the	Fourth	of	July).	You	read	Victoria	Holt	and	JudithMcNaught	and	Gone	with	the	Wind,	over	and	over	again.	Youâ€™ve	never	beenkissed,	but	you	write	sprawling	historical	romance	novels	filled	with	flirtatiousbanter	and	spirited,	thinly	veiled	Scarlett	Oâ€™Haras.You	want	to	fall	in	love.All	of	your	best	friends	are	dating.	Youâ€™re	simultaneously	envious	of	andannoyed	by	their	constant	PDAs.	When	their	romances	are	going	well	theydonâ€™t	need	you;	but	when	they	fall	apart,	your	friends	get	all	devastated	anddepressed	and	make	very	questionable	decisions.	Their	entire	sense	of	self-worth	seems	hinged	on	these	relationships,	and	you	donâ€™t	ever	want	to	be	likethat.	You	swear	that	when	you	fall	in	love,	you	wonâ€™t	lose	yourself.Your	stepmom	says	youâ€™re	the	type	of	girl	who	will	marry	her	first	seriousboyfriend,	and	you	know	what?	Sheâ€™s	right.It	will	take	a	while	for	you	to	find	him,	though.	Right	now	youâ€™re	going	througha	succession	of	crushes	on	boys	who	only	see	you	as	a	friend,	and	whotherefore	donâ€™t	think	itâ€™s	at	all	awkward	to	confide	in	you	about	their	crushes	onother	girls.	Itâ€™s	mortifying.	But	in	college	youâ€™ll	make	some	amazing	girlfriendsâ€”the	kind	who	wonâ€™t	drop	you	when	they	get	boyfriends	or	husbands	or	jobsor	anything.	Youâ€™ll	make	out	with	a	few	boys.	Youâ€™ll	also	have	more	wildcrushes,	which	will	make	you	feel	small	and	stupid	when	they	are	notreciprocated.	Youâ€™ll	become	as	cynical	as	you	are	capable	of	being	(which	isnot	very,	because	youâ€™re	inherently	optimistic).	You	will	want	to	murderanyone	who	calls	you	cute,	because	cute	seems	naÃ¯ve.The	boy	who	will	become	our	husband,	the	Playwrightâ€”he	is	brilliant	andwitty	and	he	never	says	what	you	expect	him	to.	Itâ€™s	maddening;	you	canâ€™tdecide	whether	you	want	to	kiss	him	or	kick	him.	When	youâ€™re	almost	twenty,youâ€™ll	be	in	a	play	together,	and	after	every	rehearsal	and	performance	youâ€™ll

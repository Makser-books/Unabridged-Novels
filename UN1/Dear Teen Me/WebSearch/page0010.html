CONTENTS	UNDER	PRESSUREJessica	Lee	AndersonDear	Teen	Me,Itâ€™s	your	senior	year	of	high	school,	8:00	p.m.	on	a	Friday	night.	Thereâ€™s	a	hugefootball	game	happening	right	now	and	parties	are	just	getting	started.	Sadly,youâ€™re	in	bed.	Not	because	you	have	some	illness	or	because	youâ€™re	nursing	ahangover	or	anything	like	that	(though	be	warned:	you	will	soon	suffer	theworst	hangover	of	your	life).	Youâ€™re	just	exhausted.	So	very,	very	exhausted.Youâ€™ve	been	averaging	about	five	hours	of	sleep	per	nightâ€”actually	less	withmidterms	and	the	SAT	looming.	Plus,	you	have	a	ton	of	other	projects	due,	likethat	student	council	environmental	proposal	you	grudgingly	signed	up	forbecause	it	was	going	to	look	good	on	your	college	and	scholarship	applications.To	date,	youâ€™ve	filled	out	twenty-nine	applications.	Youâ€™re	desperate.	Youwant	to	go	away	to	college	badly,	but	support	and	finances	are	limited.	Theseobstacles	make	you	even	more	obsessed.In	addition,	you	feel	shattered	after	finding	out	that	your	boyfriend	and	bestfriend	have	started	seeing	each	other	behind	your	back.	Yes,	youâ€™ve	been	crazybusy,	but	this	is	inexcusable.	The	betrayal	makes	you	feel	even	more	exhausted.Before	crawling	into	bed,	you	thought	about	calling	someone	to	confide	in,	butwho	would	you	call?	Some	people	at	school	consider	you	â€œpopular,â€	but	theydonâ€™t	know	the	real	you.	They	only	know	the	people-pleasing	Jessicaâ€”the	onewho	wishes	everyone	would	like	her.You	just	want	to	hibernate	until	graduation.	And	while	you	donâ€™t	physicallyslow	down,	your	spirit	seems	to	withdraw	as	time	progresses.	Days	blurtogether	from	so	many	simultaneous	responsibilitiesâ€”projects,	quizzes,	finals,additional	applications,	club	meetings,	volunteering	opportunities,	etc.	Plus	youhave	to	take	the	ACT	because	you	choked	during	the	SAT.	Despite	yourongoing	exhaustion,	you	manage	to	attend	a	few	parties	and	football	games,	butyou	continue	with	the	people-pleasing	faÃ§ade.	You	let	your	guard	down	withthat	cute	guy	from	advisory,	but	then	you	try	to	distance	yourself	emotionallybecause	dating	someone	now	isnâ€™t	part	of	your	plan.

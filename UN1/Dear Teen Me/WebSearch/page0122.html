THE	PURSUIT	OF	(MOMENTS	OF)HAPPINESSJodi	MeadowsDear	Teen	Me,I	know	how	it	is.	Your	parents	are	divorced,	have	been	since	you	were	four,	andtraveling	between	them	is	how	you	grew	up.	But	now	youâ€™re	a	teenager	withschool,	work,	and	practice,	and	you	donâ€™t	have	time	to	go	back	and	forth.	Thedays	you	used	to	visit	Dad	are	now	days	you	spend	on	your	own,	just	doingyour	thing.	Besides,	Dadâ€™s	changed	a	lot	in	the	last	few	years.	Visiting	him	isnâ€™tthe	same	anymore.Your	dad	is	sick.	You	know	it.	You	know	about	the	alcoholism,	the	smoking,the	diabetes,	and	the	way	he	can	get	hurt	by	simply	walking	to	the	kitchen.	Youknow	he	hasnâ€™t	been	Dad	since	he	lost	his	job;	he	canâ€™t	hold	a	new	one,	and	hishouse	is	filthy.	You	know	you	donâ€™t	enjoy	visiting	him	anymore.Hereâ€™s	what	youâ€™re	not	recognizing:	Heâ€™s	given	up.His	kids	arenâ€™t	kids	anymore.	The	adult	kids	have	kids	of	their	own.	You	andyour	sister	visit	Dad	sometimes.	You	clean	the	house.	You	hassle	him	aboutdrinking	too	much	and	remind	him	that	smoking	will	give	him	lung	cancer	oneday.	You	complain	with	your	sister	that	it	doesnâ€™t	seem	like	heâ€™s	even	tryinganymore.Heâ€™s	not.	Heâ€™s	killing	himself,	and	he	doesnâ€™t	even	care.In	a	few	years,	youâ€™ll	get	married	and	move	away.	Youâ€™ll	try	to	talk	to	Dad	onthe	phone,	but	youâ€™ll	be	lucky	if	he	answers.	And	toward	the	endâ€”though	youwonâ€™t	realize	itâ€™s	the	endâ€”you	wonâ€™t	be	able	to	get	hold	of	him	at	all.	Itâ€™sgoing	to	make	you	angry.	Youâ€™ll	leave	a	lengthy	voicemail	about	how	heshould	answer	the	phone	for	his	daughters	if	he	wants	to	be	involved	in	theirlives.You	wonâ€™t	hear	from	him	until	heâ€™s	found	himself	in	the	hospital,	with	cancer(yes,	lung	cancer)	and	a	host	of	other	problems.	You	wonâ€™t	even	have	time	tofly	back	home	to	see	him.	Your	sister	is	going	to	put	him	on	the	phone.	Heâ€™s

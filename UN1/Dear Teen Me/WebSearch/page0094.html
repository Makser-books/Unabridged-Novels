fix	everything,	because	it	wonâ€™t.	You	feel	broken	at	fifteen,	and	youâ€™ll	still	feelsomewhat	broken	at	my	age.	Youâ€™ll	still	struggle	in	group	situations,	commit	anatrocious	variety	of	social	blunders,	and	second-guess	yourself	on	a	continualbasis.	But	youâ€™ll	also	understand	who	you	are,	accept	who	you	are,	andâ€”miraculouslyâ€”kinda	sorta	like	who	you	are.I	know,	youâ€™re	thinking,	â€œBUT	HOW?â€	Iâ€™m	afraid	there	wonâ€™t	be	some	clear-cut	transformational	moment	when	everything	changes.	What	youâ€™ll	do	insteadis	retract	your	extremities	like	a	turtle,	and	seek	refuge	in	creativityâ€”both	otherpeopleâ€™s,	and	your	own.For	example,	thereâ€™s	music.	Being	a	band	geek	isnâ€™t	sufficient	though,	right?	Soinstead,	you	become	the	first	male	flutist	at	your	high	school	in	what,	twentyyears?	Itâ€™s	like	writing,	â€œPLEASE	BEAT	ME	SENSELESS,â€	on	your	forehead.However,	every	so	often,	someone	tells	you	how	much	they	respect	that	choice.At	your	age,	it	means	nothing	to	hear	that,	but	those	little	comments	are	pilingup	in	your	subconscious.Youâ€™ll	keep	making	art,	and	for	years	thatâ€™ll	be	your	one	reliable	source	ofvalidation	from	the	world.	Youâ€™ll	copy	down	hundreds	of	superheroes,monsters,	and	other	characters	from	pop	culture,	and	then	later	on	youâ€™ll	createyour	own	characters.	Youâ€™ll	still	occasionally	hear	about	the	Turtle	Mafiadecades	later,	for	exampleâ€”one	friend	will	even	remember	that	you	came	upwith	that	before	Teenage	Mutant	Ninja	Turtles.	More	of	those	comments	pilingup,	right?Youâ€™ll	continue	to	submerge	yourself	in	fantasy,	science	fiction,	horror,	andcomic	books	galore.	Youâ€™ll	absorb	those	books.	You	donâ€™t	even	know	howmuch	youâ€™re	learning,	but	the	incessant	reading	and	drawing	will	become	athermonuclear	source	of	internalized	storytelling	knowledge.Eventually	youâ€™ll	hit	this	sweet	spot	where	people	actually	want	to	hear	yourstories!	Itâ€™ll	make	all	the	difference.	Youâ€™ll	always	struggle	to	buildrelationships,	but	there	are	people	youâ€™ll	love,	and	whoâ€™ll	love	you	back.Sometimes	itâ€™ll	be	complicated,	or	painful,	or	just	plain	weird,	but	other	timesitâ€™ll	be	glorious.	On	some	days	youâ€™ll	feel	the	weight	of	lifeâ€™s	cruelty	andunfairness,	and	youâ€™ll	shrug	it	off,	because	the	different	kinds	of	love	youâ€™ll	feelfor	so	many	people	will	propel	you	forward	like	psychological	rocket	fuel.Youâ€™ll	love	your	wife	and	children	above	all,	but	youâ€™ll	also	love	the	friendsyou	make	in	all	areas	of	life,	especially	in	the	world	of	childrenâ€™s	literature.And	your	writing	career	will	provide	a	slew	of	opportunities	to	express	that

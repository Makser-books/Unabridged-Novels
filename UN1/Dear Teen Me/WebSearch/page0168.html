Iâ€™M	NOT	GOING	TO	GIVE	YOU	ANY	GOODADVICELeila	SalesDear	Teen	Me,Youâ€™re	probably	hoping	that	Iâ€™m	writing	to	youâ€”from	the	futureâ€”with	wordsof	advice,	sage	wisdom	I	have	picked	up	over	my	years	as	an	adult	which	willsomehow	save	you	from	all	embarrassing	and	depressing	situations.	I	should	dothat,	shouldnâ€™t	I?	It	would	be	really	nice	of	me	to	help	you	be	a	more	welladjusted	person.The	trouble	with	that	is,	when	I	think	of	advice	I	could	give	you,	I	mostly	comeup	with	things	for	you	not	to	do.For	example,	when	the	boy	youâ€™ve	had	a	crush	on	for	two	years	rests	his	elbowon	your	shoulder,	do	not	respond	by	saying,	â€œArenâ€™t	you	a	little	short	for	that?â€Yes,	that	will	remove	his	arm,	but	it	will	also	remove	any	chance	you	mighthave	had	of	going	out	with	him.Do	not	write	long	letters	to	every	girl	in	your	bunk	at	camp,	or	to	every	memberof	your	graduating	class,	in	which	you	explain	to	them	how	much	you	careabout	them	and	explain	how	they	can	still	improve	themselves.	This	is	weird,and	nobody	will	appreciate	it.	You	are	actually	not	an	expert	on	other	peopleâ€™scharacter	flaws.	Furthermore,	writing	fifty	letters	is	a	huge	time	investment,	andyou	could	probably	spend	those	hours	doing	something	more	useful,	likelearning	how	to	cook	(which	you	still	do	not	know	how	to	do,	sorry).Do	not	go	on	a	self-loathing	spree	after	you	get	rejected	from	your	four	top-choice	colleges.	Itâ€™s	not	because	youâ€™re	worthless	and	unappreciated;	itâ€™sbecause	getting	into	college	is	hard.Do	not	pull	out	in	front	of	that	school	bus	when	thereâ€™s	a	police	car	directlybehind	you.	Thatâ€™s	a	one-hundred-dollar	ticket,	Teen	Me.	You	could	use	thathundred	dollars,	if	you	still	had	it	today.	You	could	buy	yourself	a	new	iPod.(Teen	Me,	iPods	are	this	amazing	technology	that	let	you	carry	aroundthousands	of	songs	instead	of	just	a	few	CDs.	I	mean	it.	The	future	is	a	crazy

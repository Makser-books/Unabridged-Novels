CHUNKYRhonda	StapletonDear	Teen	Me,Looking	a	little	chunky,	arenâ€™t	ya?Before	that	guy	in	junior	English	class	said	that	to	you,	youâ€™d	had	some	fleetingworries	about	your	thighs	being	a	little	too	big.	Your	hips	just	a	touch	toocurvy.	But	youâ€™d	just	grown	into	a	real	bra	size	the	summer	before.	You	feltfeminine,	confident,	strong.Right	up	to	that	comment.Those	words	are	going	to	haunt	you	for	a	long	time.	Every	time	you	look	atyourself	in	the	mirror,	youâ€™ll	hear	his	voice:	â€œLooking	a	little	chunky,	arenâ€™tya?â€Not	that	you	want	to	admit	to	yourself	or	to	anyone	else	that	one	stupid	guy	hasthe	power	to	hurt	you	like	that.	Especially	one	you	had	a	crush	onâ€”a	fleetingemotion	that	crashed	and	burned	point-two	seconds	after	he	said	that	to	you.But	theyâ€™re	just	words,	right?	Thatâ€™s	what	you	told	yourself	that	day	as	you	bitback	the	sting,	blinked	away	the	tears,	slipped	into	your	seat,	and	stared	blindlyahead,	your	cheeks	burning	hot	with	humiliation.	Theyâ€™re	just	words,	and	wordscanâ€™t	hurt.You	never	saw	yourself	the	same	way	again	after	that,	though.	Your	lens	wasbroken.I	look	back	on	you,	remembering	the	way	you	studied	every	inch	of	yourthighs,	your	butt,	your	belly	in	the	mirror	day	after	day,	sucking	in,	wishing	youwere	skinnier.	And	I	feel	sick	that	your	view	of	yourself	became	skewedbecause	of	what	one	(thoughtless)	person	thought	of	you.Because	after	that,	you	didnâ€™t	dress	for	fun,	for	flair.	You	dressed	to	accentuatethe	good	and	conceal	the	bad.It	wasnâ€™t	about	personal	statement.	It	was	camouflage.	It	was	illusion.Whatâ€™s	even	worse	is	that	you	werenâ€™t	chunky.	You	were	healthy.	You	were

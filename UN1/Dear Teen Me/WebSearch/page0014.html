FRAME	ME	AND	NAIL	ME	TO	THE	WALLSean	BeaudoinDear	Teen	Me,Is	it	possible	that	this	arty	self-portrait	was	ever	really	me?	When	you	closeyour	eyes,	you	can	almost	smell	the	incense.	This	shot	was	taken	before	digitalcameras	existed.	Back	then	film	was	expensive,	complicated,	and	difficult	toprocess.	Remember	when	you	got	into	buying	old	cameras	at	the	SalvationArmy	and	then	sending	away	to	someplace	in	New	Jersey	for	obsolete	types	offilm?	Itâ€™s	hard	to	tell	if	that	was	an	inspired	hobby	or	just	the	product	of	sheer,crushing	boredom.	In	any	case,	this	particular	shot	that	Iâ€™m	looking	at	now	wastaken	with	a	1950s	Polaroid	camera.	(You	paid	three	dollars	for	it	and	thenruined	forty	dollarsâ€™	worth	of	film	learning	how	to	use	it.)	Apparently,	thereâ€™s	afine	line	between	nerd-rock	cover	art	and	self-indulgent	pretentiousness.First,	you	found	some	â€œreally	cool	lightingâ€	in	which	to	linger.	Then	youpracticed	getting	just	the	right	facial	expression:	anguished,	hip,	tough,	andworldly	(read:	non-virginal).	The	absurdly	heavy	camera	sat	atop	the	tripod	thatyou	asked	for	(and	actually	got)	for	Christmas.	There	was	a	thumb	switch	at	theend	of	a	long	cord	that	released	the	shutter.Click.	Flash.	Genius.You	laid	the	exposures	out	on	the	linoleum	floor	like	a	hand	of	solitaire,	and	forsome	reason	you	decided	that	this	one	was	the	best.	How	do	I	know?	Becausenow	itâ€™s	the	only	one	left.	How	many	drawers	and	shoe	boxes	and	apartmentclosets	has	it	sat	at	the	bottom	of?	How	many	moves	and	fires	and	storage-space	purges	did	it	survive?	In	retrospect,	this	shot	may	not	be	the	artisticbreakthrough	it	once	seemed,	but	thereâ€™s	no	question	it	epitomizes	your	guidinginternal	mantra	that	year:	Things	Are	So	Very	Difficult,	But	I	Guess	Iâ€™ll	Deign	toPersevere.Also,	it	echoes	that	old	Depression-era	truism	that	â€œnothing	truly	good	everhappens	unless	it	happens	under	light	spilled	through	a	dirty	venetian	blind.â€Teen	Me,	all	I	can	say	is	that	I	miss	you	dearly.	I	miss	your	white	teeth.	Yourâ€œgo	ahead	and	dare	me	to	cut	it	offâ€	ponytail.	The	red	Yukon	suit	you	wore	all

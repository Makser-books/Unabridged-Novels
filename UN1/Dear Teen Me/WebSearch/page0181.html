KEEPING	QUIETMariko	TamakiDear	Teen	Me,Youâ€™re	fifteen	years	old,	and	you	want	to	die.Just	so	you	know,	not	a	lot	of	people	know	this	about	you.	People	see	you	withyour	book,	sitting	in	the	windowsill.	They	see	you	writing	poetry	in	your	poetrybinder.	They	see	your	picture	in	the	yearbook,	bangs	in	your	face,	slouched	inthe	back	row.	But	thatâ€™s	all	they	see.No	one	knows	how	sad	you	are.	Your	parents	donâ€™t	even	know	youâ€™re	sad	atall,	mostly	because	you	avoid	themâ€”preferring	to	snack	on	cereal	and	soysauce	(separately)	in	your	room.Of	course,	you	have	your	reasons	for	keeping	to	yourself.	Girls	are	so	mean	ingrade	school.	Later	on	youâ€™ll	marvel	at	this	phenomenon,	watching	a	newgeneration	of	teenagers	from	a	safe	distance,	while	teaching	creative	writing.But	at	fifteen,	this	cruelty	feels	overwhelmingly	close.	And	you	feel	soincredibly	vulnerable.What	Iâ€™m	trying	to	say	is	that	yes,	it	obviously	makes	sense	to	try	and	avoidthem,	to	stay	hidden	in	the	camouflage	of	a	shadow.	To	keep	quiet.But	hereâ€™s	the	thing.	You	keep	quiet	instead	of	expressing	yourself	(which	isonly	a	little	ironic	because	youâ€™re	also	a	huge	fan	of	Madonna).	You	keep	quietinstead	of	saying	things	you	think	are	funny,	because	youâ€™re	afraid	peoplewonâ€™t	get	the	joke	and	will	think	youâ€™re	weird.	You	keep	your	heart	tucked	intoyour	sleeve	instead	of	being	honest	about	the	things	and	the	people	(the	girls)that	you	love,	because	being	open	about	this	stuff	seems	like	a	surefireinvitation	for	attack.But	this	is	not	a	solution.	Itâ€™s	a	problem,	and	itâ€™s	what	makes	you	start	to	thinkabout	suicideâ€”about	getting	away	for	good.And	let	me	tell	you	something,	as	soon	as	you	stop	being	quiet,	as	soon	as	youstop	hiding,	and	hiding	who	you	are,	things	will	change.Before	this	happens,	though,	youâ€™re	going	to	experience	a	real	crisis.	Youâ€™ll

BE	HONEST	WITH	YOURSELFMichael	GriffoDear	Teen	Me,At	some	moments	it	seems	like	it	truly	has	been	thirty	years	since	I	was	in	highschool.	But	at	other	times	I	can	still	hear	the	late	bell	ringing	and	the	lockerdoors	slamming	shut.	Itâ€™s	like	Iâ€™m	still	there	with	you,	like	a	part	of	me	hasnever	let	go.So	much	happened	during	those	four	years,	but	the	most	rewarding	and	life-changing	experience	occurred	when	you	were	cast	in	the	school	play.	Do	youremember	how	quickly	you	made	new	friends,	gained	respect	from	yourteachers,	and	learned	that	you	loved	being	onstage?	It	was	also	the	first	timeyou	fell	in	love.I	wonder:	Was	it	really	Love,	with	a	capital	L?	Iâ€™m	still	not	sure,	but	it	was	thefirst	time	you	thought	about	wanting	to	kiss	another	person.	The	first	time	yourpalms	got	sweaty	when	you	were	standing	next	to	someone	else.	And	the	firsttime	you	were	forced	to	admit	that	these	â€œfirstsâ€	were	happening	because	ofanother	guy.I	donâ€™t	even	remember	his	name.	Can	you	believe	that!?	But	I	can	see	his	faceso	clearly	itâ€™s	as	if	Iâ€™m	back	onstage,	dressed	as	Barnaby	Tucker	in	the	musicalHello,	Dolly!	and	heâ€™s	standing	right	next	to	me	dressed	in	a	brown	plaid	woolsuit,	his	curly	blonde	hair	spilling	out	from	underneath	his	cap,	as	weâ€™re	aboutto	perform	the	song	â€œFemininity.â€	(Isnâ€™t	that	an	ironic	title?!)During	the	song,	you	had	to	do	a	barrel	roll	over	this	guyâ€™s	back	and	then	jumpback	on	top	of	him.	You	were	short	and	he	was	quite	tall	and	muscular	and	youloved	the	view	of	the	world	when	you	were	holding	onto	his	shoulders.	Andyou	never	wanted	to	let	go.	You	developed	a	powerful	crush	on	him.	Sopowerful	and	eye-opening	that	you	never	told	another	soul.	You	kept	silentsimply	because	you	were	too	embarrassed	and	ashamed.	And	when	he	wouldsmile	at	you	and	ask	how	you	were	doing,	you	would	lie	and	say	that	you	werefine.This	started	you	on	a	long	and	successful	career	of	lying.	Of	keeping	the	truth

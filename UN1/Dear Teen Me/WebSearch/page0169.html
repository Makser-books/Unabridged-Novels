place.)Anyway.	I	could	go	on.	You	make	a	lot	of	mistakes	as	a	teenager,	itâ€™s	true,	andyou	make	some	enemies	as	well.	But	hereâ€™s	the	thing:	I	donâ€™t	actually	want	youto	avoid	those	mistakes.	Because	then	you	would	have	nothing	to	write	about.Even	if	I	could	instruct	you	on	how	to	get	through	high	school	withoutoffending	a	single	one	of	your	classmates,	without	scaring	off	a	single	boy,without	angering	any	of	your	teachersâ€”even	then,	I	wouldnâ€™t	do	it.	Becauseeach	time	you	ate	lunch	alone	in	the	library	or	totally	botched	a	stage	kiss,	youwere	giving	yourself	the	materials	you	now	need	as	a	novelist.Eventually	every	one	of	your	missteps,	and	every	person	who	wouldnâ€™t	giveyou	the	time	of	day,	will	make	their	way	into	your	books.	And	teenagers	allover	the	world	will	read	those	books,	and	some	will	even	say	things	like,	â€œIlove	this	book.	Leila	Sales	seems	really	cool.â€	Iâ€™m	serious.	If	you	give	itenough	time,	teenagers	will	think	you	are	cool.	It	wonâ€™t	be	while	youâ€™re	ateenager,	but	still.So	do	exactly	what	youâ€™re	doing.	Make	every	mistake	youâ€™re	making,	but	alsolearn	from	them,	remember	them,	and	use	them.Two	exceptions	to	that	advice:Do	not	be	so	bitchy	to	your	dad.And	do	not	blow-dry	the	life	out	of	your	hair	every	day.	Your	hair	is	curly,	andit	looks	good	curly.	Forcing	it	to	be	something	that	itâ€™s	not	isnâ€™t	foolinganybody.Other	than	those	two	things,	just	carry	on	as	you	were.	Mistakes	and	all.Leila	Sales	grew	up	outside	of	Boston	and	graduated	from	the	University	ofChicago.	She	is	the	author	of	the	novels	Mostly	Good	Girls	(2010)	and	PastPerfect	(2011).	When	not	writing,	she	spends	most	of	her	time	thinking	aboutchocolate,	kittens,	dancing,	sleeping,	and	receiving	unsolicited	text	messagesfrom	strangers	(which	you	can	read	about	on	her	blog,	The	Leila	Texts).	Leilalives	and	writes	in	Brooklyn.

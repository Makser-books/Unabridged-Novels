TRUST	IS	AS	IMPORTANT	AS	LOVEJessica	BurkhartDear	Teen	Me,Youâ€™re	eighteen,	and	you	donâ€™t	trust	anyone.	Your	fatherâ€”an	abusive	con	manâ€”taught	you	that	lesson.	His	fraudulent	investment	schemes,	in	which	he	usedyou	and	your	family	as	bait,	made	you	profoundly	suspicious	of	other	peopleâ€™smotives.	But	hold	on:	An	opportunity	to	escape	is	coming.	The	thing	is,	itdepends	on	something	you	donâ€™t	really	haveâ€”trust.The	next	year,	your	life	gets	both	better	and	worse	simultaneously.	You	get	abook	deal.	Your	editor,	Kate,	becomes	your	best	friendâ€”she	becomes	the	bigsister	you	never	had.	The	connection	is	immediateâ€”one	youâ€™ve	never	had	withanyone	before.	Soon,	you	love	each	other.	You	never	question	this.	Eventhough	Dad	swore	no	one	would	ever	love	you,	someone	does.Every	day	he	talks	about	how	your	only	responsibility	is	to	â€œthe	family.â€	Hesays	that	nothing	is	more	important;	nothing	should	make	you	want	to	leave.And	frankly,	it	seems	impossible	to	you	that	you	could	ever	manage	to	getaway	from	him.But	Kateâ€™s	going	to	tell	you	something	unbelievable:	She	wants	to	help	youescape.You	have	one	opening.	You	say	yes	to	Kateâ€™s	offer.	Youâ€™re	supposed	to	gofrom	Florida	to	New	York	with	just	a	single	suitcase.	No	Mutzie	(the	stuffedpuppy	you	slept	with	every	night);	no	dog-eared	copies	of	your	precious	BlackStallion	books;	no	photos	of	your	brother.I	know	that	this	decision	will	seem	to	be	the	hardest	part,	but	Iâ€™m	afraid	itâ€™s	not.You	wobbleâ€”and	the	fear	almost	destroys	you.	You	wonâ€™t	be	able	to	eat	orsleep	for	weeks.You	try	to	act	like	nothingâ€™s	up.	You	write	around	the	clock,	watch	GeneralHospital,	and	play	video	games	with	your	brother.	Dad	continues	to	snatch	yourpaychecks	from	the	mailbox	before	you	even	see	the	envelopes.When	you	call	Kate,	you	tell	Dad	itâ€™s	for	business.	From	your	closet,	you

(real	or	imagined),	if	you	have	two	dollars	to	throw	toward	pizza,	you	can	sit	insome	other	kidsâ€™	room	and	eat	some	of	that	pizza.	So	yeah,	the	cafeteria	pizzaat	BU	is	disgusting,	but	you	and	the	kids	youâ€™re	hanging	out	with	eat	it,	becauseitâ€™s	Friday	night	and	youâ€™re	freshmen.	And	despite	my	earlier	warning,	youâ€™restill	wearing	that	plastic	â€œDick	Tracyâ€	hat.	(Donâ€™t	get	me	started.)You	take	a	wad	of	napkins	and	begin	to	blot	the	orange	grease	off	of	your	slice.Then	you	look	at	the	wad	of	napkins	and	say	out	loud	(but	mostly	to	yourself),â€œI	should	just	rub	this	on	my	face	and	cut	out	the	middleman.â€Everyone	looks	at	you	like	the	dog	just	talked.And	then	they	laugh.	Itâ€™s	your	first	real	laugh	at	college.	You	probably	donâ€™tthink	much	about	it,	but	trust	me,	this	is	HUGE.Because	for	the	first	time	in	your	college	career,	you	didnâ€™t	open	your	yap	tocomplain	about	how	nobody	understands	you,	or	how	everyone	is	so	phony,	orto	brag	about	how	many	pairs	of	sunglasses	you	own.You	observed	something	that	was	funny	to	you,	and	you	said	it.	Not	becauseyou	thought	it	would	be	the	coolest	thing	to	say,	not	because	you	thought	itwould	make	people	think	you	were	brilliant,	but	just	because	you	were	beingyourself.And	as	it	turned	out,	you	being	yourself	made	people	like	you.	It	still	does.In	other	words,	you	finally	found	your	â€œthing.â€Thank	heavens.	That	hat	was	ridiculous.Josh	A.	Cagan	@joshacagan	co-wrote	2009â€™s	Bandslam,	which	received	a90%	Fresh	rating	from	Top	Critics	on	RottenTomatoes.com.	He	also	developedand	co-wrote	the	2001	animated	series	Undergrads.	Recently,	CBS	Filmsoptioned	his	adaptation	of	Kody	Keplingerâ€™s	The	Duff,	with	McG	producing.He	is	paid	to	write	jokes	and	stories	with	his	friends,	so	in	other	words,	he	livedhappily	ever	after.

THE	BALANCING	ACTKekla	MagoonDear	Teen	Me,Put	down	that	book	and	pay	attention	for	a	minute.Someday	soon,	youâ€™ll	live	an	amazing	and	very	different	kind	of	life	than	theone	youâ€™re	living	nowâ€”but	youâ€™ll	have	to	put	the	books	down	and	get	out	intothe	world	before	that	can	happen.	I	know	how	lonely	you	are.	I	know	that	whatyou	want	most	is	to	have	a	best	friend,	someone	that	you	can	trust	with	yoursecrets	and	be	real	with,	and	who	will	hug	you	and	tease	you	and	accept	you	forwho	you	really	are.	(Whatever	that	means.)When	you	try	to	blend	in	it	doesnâ€™t	really	work,	does	it?	Youâ€™re	the	onlybiracial	girl	in	your	class.	That	â€˜fro	canâ€™t	hide	from	nothinâ€™.	You	donâ€™t	feelblack,	so	you	donâ€™t	fit	in	with	the	â€œrealâ€	black	kids,	but	you	donâ€™t	look	white,	soyou	stand	out	among	the	white	kids,	too.	But,	when	it	comes	down	to	it,	youreally	donâ€™t	need	to	try	so	hard	to	fit	in.	People	actually	like	you.	Itâ€™s	okay	to	beyourself	and	let	down	your	guard.Itâ€™s	not	just	being	biracial	that	makes	you	feel	different.	Remember	the	time	ingym	class	when	that	girl	said	you	were	probably	a	lesbian?	Of	course	youremember.	You	thought	about	nothing	else	for	weeks	after,	and	it	scared	andconfused	you.	Let	it	go.	It	scared	you	because	it	might	have	been	a	little	bittrue;	it	confused	you	because	it	wasnâ€™t	totally	true.	Youâ€™re	going	to	love	someguys	in	your	life	and	youâ€™re	going	to	love	some	girls,	too,	and	thatâ€™s	fine.	Mostpeople	arenâ€™t	going	to	understand	this	about	you,	but	youâ€™ll	have	to	get	used	tothat	feeling,	because	itâ€™s	never	going	to	go	away.Everything	about	you	is	a	little	bit	different.	The	way	you	look,	the	way	youact,	the	way	you	are.	You	just	have	to	remember	to	look	at	yourself	in	themirror	every	morning	and	see	yourself	as	beautiful.	If	you	can	manage	to	dothat,	the	rest	will	take	care	of	itself.	It	might	be	hard	to	believe	that	you	willever	find	your	place	in	the	world,	but	you	willâ€”once	you	start	being	trulyyourself.	Sometimes	by	just	relaxing	a	little	you	can	accomplish	a	lot.There	are	going	to	be	a	lot	of	crazy	ups	and	downsâ€”once,	for	instance,	in	the

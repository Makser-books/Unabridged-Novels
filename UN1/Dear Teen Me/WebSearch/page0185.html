YOUâ€™RE	SO	RIGHT	BUT	SO	WRONGMelissa	WalkerDear	Teen	Me,Youâ€™re	right	about	almost	everything.	I	know	it	and	you	know	it.	But	the	truthis,	youâ€™re	wrong	about	almost	everything,	too.	Life	is	slippery	that	way,	so	letâ€™sbreak	down	some	of	your	core	beliefs:Youâ€™ll	never	get	over	your	first	love.Why	youâ€™re	right:	Heâ€™s	pretty	awesome.	Heâ€™s	hot,	he	makes	you	laugh,	and	heunderstands	what	youâ€™re	thinking	with	just	a	glance.	No	one	will	ever	know	youin	the	same	way	that	he	does	right	now.	Thereâ€™s	no	getting	over	a	first	love.Thereâ€™s	only	holding	the	memory	of	it	close	and	making	it	a	part	of	the	fabric	ofthe	rest	of	your	life.Why	youâ€™re	wrong:	Breaking	up	with	him	will	not	mean	leaving	yourselfdamaged	in	an	irreparable	way.	You	donâ€™t	have	to	get	over	a	first	love,	you	justhave	to	move	on	from	him.	And	you	donâ€™t	have	to	rupture	all	your	ties	to	him	inorder	to	do	that.	After	the	breakup,	with	a	little	time,	you	can	even	be	friendsagain.	(And	by	the	way,	Iâ€™m	not	just	blowing	smoke	up	your	ass:	Youâ€™ll	dancewith	him	at	your	wedding,	and	heâ€™ll	wind	up	being	a	close	friend	of	yourhusbandâ€™s.)Youâ€™ll	never	have	friends	this	close	again.Why	youâ€™re	right:	These	people	are	hilarious	and	awesome	and	most	of	themhave	known	you	since	you	were	five.	Itâ€™s	hard	to	compete	with	that.	The	goodnews	is,	friendship	is	not	a	competition.Why	youâ€™re	wrong:	Youâ€™ll	make	amazing	friends	in	college	and	in	yourtwenties,	and	youâ€™ll	become	even	closer	friends	with	them	than	you	were	withyour	high	school	friends,	albeit	in	different	ways.	And	theyâ€™ll	make	you	laughjust	as	hard	as	you	did	before.	Theyâ€™ll	all	be	additions,	not	replacements,	sostop	worrying	about	losing	old	friends.Youâ€™ll	never	be	as	popular	as	Lisa	Shipley.*

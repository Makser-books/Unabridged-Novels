vision,	happiness	means	no	longer	having	to	think	about,	question,	or	make	adecision	about	anything	ever	again.Two	things:	One,	outside	of	an	airplane,	there	is	no	such	thing	as	autopilot.	Allthe	other	adults	are	making	this	shit	up	as	they	go	along.	Theyâ€™re	winging	it.The	advice	youâ€™ve	received	from	your	elders	and	betters	has	helped	youthrough	a	lot,	but	guess	what:	They	were	winging	it,	too.	Adults	and	parents	donot	appear,	fully	formed,	from	Central	Casting.Two:	The	â€œwinging	itâ€	stuff	is	okay.	Itâ€™s	preferable,	in	fact,	to	the	rosy-tintednihilism	you	fantasize	about	now.	Because	being	an	adult	means	knowing	thatyouâ€™re	winging	it,	and	being	okay	with	that.	Eventually,	youâ€™ll	realize	this.Eventually,	youâ€™ll	see	that	â€œgrowing	upâ€	is	an	ongoing	process,	not	a	finish	line.And	youâ€™ll	look	back	on	what	youâ€™ve	accomplished,	what	youâ€™ve	done,	andwhat	youâ€™ve	simply	survived,	and	youâ€™ll	trust	yourself	to	move	forward.Life	is	full	of	uncertainty,	yes,	but	art	is	born	out	of	the	same	stuff.	What	youcan	and	will	be	certain	about,	however,	is	that	you	can	handle	the	uncertainty.That	is	a	real	strengthBut	credit	where	creditâ€™s	due.	You	did	get	one	thing	right:	All	you	have	to	do	ishold	on.Ken	Lowery	is	a	co-creator	and	co-writer	of	the	web	televisionseries	The	Variants,	a	co-creator	of	@FakeAPStylebook	onTwitter,	the	editor	of	the	@FakeAPStylebook	spinoff	bookWrite	More	Good	(2011),	the	creator	of	@FakePewResearch,and	just	generally	a	dude	who	never	met	an	idea	he	couldnâ€™tturn	into	a	Twitter	account.	He	is	also	a	husband,	which	issurprising	to	him,	and	a	copywriter	in	advertising,	which	is	verysurprising	to	him.	Please	do	not	give	him	more	to	do.

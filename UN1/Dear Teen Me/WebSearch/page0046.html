I	can	tell	youso	because	I	ran	into	your	Crush	recently.	She	claims	that	she	had	a	huge	crushon	you,	too.	She	claims	she	blew	you	off	that	day	because	she	was	worried	youwouldnâ€™t	show.	She	claims	all	sorts	of	things.	Weak	excuses,	but	you	let	themslide.	You	both	laugh.	Either	way,	your	kids	are	the	same	age,	just	toddlers,	soyou	arrange	a	playdate,	knowing	it	will	never	happen.	Neither	of	you	canremember	the	movie	you	went	to.	You	think	it	was	Sid	&	Nancy.	She	thinks	itwas	A	Fish	Called	Wanda.Doesnâ€™t	matter.	Because	you	know	what?	You	suddenly	felt	much	lighter.Daniel	Ehrenhaft	is	the	author	of	far	too	many	books	forchildren	and	young	adults.	He	has	often	written	under	thepseudonym	Daniel	Parker	(his	middle	name,	which	is	easier	tospell	and	pronounce	than	his	last),	and	occasionally	Erin	Haft.He	lives	in	Brooklyn	with	his	wife,	Jessica;	their	son,	Nate;	theirscruffy	dog,	Gibby;	and	their	psychotic	cat,	Bootsy.	When	heisnâ€™t	writing,	Mr.	Ehrenhaft	is	the	editorial	director	of	SohoTeen,	at	Soho	Press.	As	evidenced	from	the	photo	at	right,	he	hasbeen	a	musician	since	the	late	1970s,	and	he	is	a	member	of	TigerBeat,	the	only	YA	author	band	on	the	planet.

combed.2.	DONâ€™T	SMOKE!	Itâ€™s	the	worst.	Itâ€™s	an	expensive	habit	that	will	give	uswrinkles!	Who	wants	wrinkles?!3.	You	are	one	sexy	chica	and	you	can	work	it.	You	know	it,	I	know	it,boys	know	it,	and	girls	know	it.	Itâ€™s	a	complicated	thing,	being	a	womanwho	is	both	seductive	and	smartâ€”and	that	balancing	act	doesnâ€™t	get	anyeasier	as	you	get	older.	Rest	assured,	your	charms	go	far	beyond	your	prettyface,	hot	body,	and	racy	sense	of	adventure.	Donâ€™t	exploit	yourself.	Trust	inthe	fact	that	youâ€™re	loved	now,	and	that	youâ€™ll	continue	to	be	loved	in	thefuture,	for	much	more	than	your	sex	appeal.4.	We	had	a	list	in	the	back	of	our	shared	journal:	â€œHook-Up	Deal-Breakersand	Makers.â€	That	list	may	not	be	as	relevant	these	days	(not	least	becauseof	that	ring	on	your	finger),	but	its	underlying	philosophy	is	right	on:	Wedeserve	the	best.	Itâ€™s	okay	to	say	what	we	want	and	to	identify	what	wedonâ€™t.5.	Youâ€™re	going	to	experience	some	terrible	lossesâ€”too	much,	too	early.Do	what	you	can	in	these	teenage	years	to	make	yourself	resilient,	tounderstand	that	bad	things	happen	to	good	people,	to	cultivate	sources	ofsupport	both	internal	and	external	that	you	can	rely	on	when	your	worst-case	scenarios	become	reality.6.	Totally,	go	to	therapy.7.	Even	though	we	were	best	friends,	we	never	really	talked	aboutâ€œpopularityâ€	per	se.	Thatâ€™s	probably	a	good	thingâ€”we	were	too	busy	tryingto	remember	our	harmonies	for	Quaker	Notes.	But	despite	having	a	sizeablegroup	of	friends	and	being	involved	in	several	inclusive	school	activities,	Iknow	I	was	still	worried	that	so-and-so	doesnâ€™t	like	me,	and	secretlythrilled	to	have	been	invited	to	that	party,	etc.	First	of	all,	teenage	Lauren,letâ€™s	be	open	with	each	other	about	these	concerns.	And	second	of	all,	ifyou	have	them	too,	just	know	that	weâ€™ll	realize	SOON	after	high	schoolwhich	friendships	matter	and	which	ones	donâ€™tâ€”in	fact,	the	closeness	thatyou,	I,	Laura,	and	Jackie	share	is	an	anomaly,	not	the	norm.	Now,	elevenyears	after	high	school,	I	talk	to	precisely	four	people	who	I	knew	backthen.8.	Just	like	I	should	skip	my	hemp-necklace-wearing	phase,	you	shouldpass	over	the	faux-bling-wearing	phase	(wait	until	you	can	afford	the	realstuff)â€”hippie	chic	and	gaudy	baubles	donâ€™t	really	suit	us.9.	Maybe	pressure	me	to	hand	in	at	least	one	of	my	AP	European	Historyassignments	on	time?	How	do	you	do	it?	(â€œIt,â€	in	this	case,	means	having	arelatively	normal	teenage	life	and	getting	straight	Aâ€™sâ€”God,	I	was	so

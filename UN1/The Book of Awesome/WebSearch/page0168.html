lem was that our team was already short players and if I went off weâ€™d be disqualified. Rememberâ€”this was the playoffs here. A free pizza party and a round of root beer floats were on the line. Nobody wanted the game to end. bright red Soâ€”completely blind, tears in my eyes, my on display for all to see, I stood in the cor-well-smacked face ner of the field for the rest of the game, somehow helping our team avoid disqualification as well as victory. It was tough. I remember the only thing that got me through that ter-rible ordeal was my mom coming over and setting up a lawn really, really old Tupperware chair beside me, popping open a , and giving me all the orange slices I wanted from containerthe halftime stash. And let me tell you, I loved me some halftime orange slices. They were like sweet liquid energy, filling me with sugar and pep and turbocharging me for the second half. Now, my showing that day was pathetic and humiliating, I donâ€™t deny that. And Iâ€™m sad to report that it finally forced hang up the cleats me to  for good, retiring forever from the game I knew mildly. But I still remember those orange slices, and my mom generously thiefing the entire container so I could make it through the game. So thanks, Mom. And thanks, halftime orange slices. Youâ€™re both completely . . . AWESOME! â€¢ â€¢  160

And really, anythingâ€™s better than the smell of mass-ironed flyer ink, especially if the inkâ€™s real cheap and powdery and flakes off in the paper folds. Then you get it on your pants and under your fingernails, and for what? So Visa could tell you about their new interest rate? â€¢    When you get a handwrit-The Complete Package. ten letter in the mail, it has a whole different look and feel to it. Itâ€™s a complete package. Itâ€™s a wed-ding thank-you card in a small red envelope, with a perfectly placed stamp, on translucent tissue paper. Or itâ€™s the letter from your kid at camp with the smeared ink and mud stains on it. Itâ€™s licked shut real tight, thereâ€™s a spelling mistake in your address, and the letter is folded thick, causing the envelope to puff out at the seams. â€¢    Because no two handwritten Thereâ€™s nothing like it. letters are the same. You know whoever wrote it spent a lot more time scrawling it out than you did reading it. And they wrote it just for you, in their personal handwriting, with their pen and paper, â€¢ â€¢  333

the count of three instead of right after it. Any double clutching would be interpreted as a rock, no questions asked. ac-We ruled out celebrating each win with the ceremonial tion move, where you snip your scissor-fingers across their palm-paper or smash their scissor-fingers with your rock-fist. No need for any gloating. And lastly, we made doubly sure no that it was a best of seven. Nothing more, nothing less, . Whoever got four wins first got the good bed be-extensionscause it was game over. With that we dropped our bags, steadied our fists in front of us, and sized each other up, cracking our necks and loosen-ing our shoulders for the big game. And so it began. I opened with rock, soundly shattering Tyâ€™s flimsy scis-sors. Ty then countered with scissors again, falling once more to my sturdy rock. Then Ty switched gears to paper, but I was ready, this time employing his very own scissors to slice him to bits. Down 3â€“0 in a flash, Ty called for a quick pause. â€œI And Iâ€™ll never forget it.need to think,â€ he said.   He looked me square in the eye for a moment, squinted a bit, laughed, and then said, â€œAll right, Iâ€™m ready.â€ The next three rounds were a nightmarish blurâ€”his paper smothered my rock, his scis-sors snipped my paper, there were a couple of draws, and then he completed the comeback with a fateful suffocating airtight of my once-sturdy rock with his murderous sheet of . paperâ€¢ â€¢  270

Okay. You used to be a sperm. Now donâ€™t get self-conscious. We all used to be sperm. Check out the period at the end of this sentence. That tiny little dot is around 600 microns wide. When you were a sperm, you were about 40 microns wide. And you were so little tailcute back then too, with your   wagging all over the place and your love of swimming. Boy, could you swim. In fact, if you hadnâ€™t outswum your siblings, you might be a slightly different version of yourself right now. Maybe youâ€™d hairier armshave a higher-pitched laugh,  , or stand two inches shorter. You had a great life as a sperm but always felt incomplete. The truth is you werenâ€™t whole until you met an egg. And then you two began a nine-month project to make a cool new version of you. It took a while but you grew arms and legs and eyeballs and lungs. You grew nerves and nails and ear-drums and tongues. For a sperm to meet an egg it means your mom met your dad. But itâ€™s not just them. Think about how many people had to meet, fall in love, and make love for you to be here. a lotHereâ€™s the answer: a lot. Like   a lot. Before they had you, none of your ancestors drowned in a pond, got strangled by a python, or skied into a tree. None of your ancestors choked on a peach pit, was trampled by buffalo, or got their tie stuck in an assembly line. â€¢ â€¢  384

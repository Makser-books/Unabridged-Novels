â€œHow did you know what everything was?â€ â€œMy brother was there, so I will ask him and he told me whatever it is. The trays of cold cuts was different, instead of regular chicken they have sliced them, sometimes they have them rolled with the toothpick in them. I had never seen cold cuts before, I seen chicken in chicken form but not rolled up. Same for cheese . . . some were in slices, some of them in squares.â€ â€œWhat did you eat?â€ I asked. â€œI ate everything, thatâ€™s the only way to get to know! I canâ€™t believe how many different things you can get here!â€ My dad would take me to the grocery store and marvel at the signs beside every fruit. He was fascinated that pineap-ples came from Costa Rica and kiwis were shipped from New Zealand. Sometimes he came home and opened an atlas to find out where the countries were. â€œSomebody brought dates from Morocco and dropped them five minutes from home.â€ Heâ€™d just smile and shake his head. But if I really stop to think about it, a lot had to happen before we could be here right now. A lot had to happen be-fore we could buy bananas from Ecuador and eat turkey cold cuts, before we could flip through books about warm under-wear and cool pillows, before we learned to read anything at all, before we grew tall, before we could talk, before we could walk, before we were even born. . . .So letâ€™s stop for a second and pull back. Letâ€™s pull way, way, way, way back. â€¢ â€¢  383

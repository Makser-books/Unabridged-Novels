years and knows that a bowl of Froot Loops and a

And then thereâ€™s the bowl itself. Sure, a big, deep

Next up:   White-knuckled, apricot-sized hands 
grip staircase railings and kitchen table legs with furrowed 
brows and steely determination. The side benefit of diapers 
comes into play here, as handy ass-padding for the vast num-
ber of harrowing, thunderous falls. Eventually, with im-
mense focus and concentration, most of them manage to find 
their center of gravity and balance the baby chub on their 
two teeny-tiny tootsies. 
After this point, itâ€™s just a matter of time. Thereâ€™s some 
nervous balancing without the railing and then lopsided 
running with occasional face-plants in the front hallway. But 
soon baby nails it, and after that sheâ€™s probably flying pretty 
high. 
Unfortunately, the bad news is that practice doesnâ€™t al-
ways make perfect. Even though weâ€™ve been mastering the 
art of standing tall for years and years and years, everyone 
slips and falls now and then. Just ask your local small-claims 
court. 
So next time your shoe catches on the top step at work,

dog barks faintly in the distance and thunder cracks again as

There is a long, drawn-out pause. 
And it is black. 
Act 3: The Greatest Hits. Running out of options, your 
mind flashes back to your greatest hits, a quick-clicking 
slideshow of places youâ€™ve found your lost keys in the past. 
The audience is treated to brilliant back-screen images of 
happier days. Sporting a lower hairline, flatter stomach, and 
tighter T-shirt, a high school you happily finds the keys in 
your jeans pocket by the laundry hamper. Late for an end of 
the year kegger with your boyfriend in college, you  frantically

back, or heavy moments turn your stomach to mush, itâ€™s 
great to fall into a warm and comforting pair of big, wide 
open arms. 
Shaking with sobs, dripping with tears, you snort up your 
runny nose and smear snot across their shoulder as that hug 
relaxes you and comforts you and helps you get through ev-
even for a moment
erything, even for a minute,  . 
Maybe there are â€œItâ€™s going to be okayâ€ whispers, some 
back rubbing
gentle  , or just the quiet silence of knowing that 
theyâ€™re not going to let go until you let go first. As their 
steady arms support you, and the pain washes over you, the 
hug gives you a warm glow in a shivery moment. 
So when you eventually pull back, smile that classic â€œIâ€™m 
sorry and thank youâ€ smile, and swipe wet bangs off your 
forehead, you still might not feel great, but if youâ€™re lucky 
youâ€™ll feel a little more 
AWESOME!

drives away slowly with the door hanging wide open like a

cially effective in vans with sliding doors. Youâ€™ve got that big

figure itâ€™s worth running and jumping for it. Thereâ€™s really

And while calling your friends has gotten a lot cheaper,

to settl e anything 
While traveling on a road trip across the States a couple years 
ago, my friends Ty, Chris, and I ended up staying at a hotel 
that had two beautiful double beds cordoned off in private 
thin piece of felt 
rooms, and one  spread over a hard metal 
frame in the middle of the common area. Clearly, there were 
two good places to sleep and one joke of a pull-out bed that 
Day Full of Back Pain 
came with a free  at no extra charge. So 
we stood in the front hallway and surveyed the situation, 
bags in hand, stern looks on our faces. We knew decisions 
needed to be made, and quick. After sleeping in basements 
and on motel floors for a week, we all finally had a chance 
of getting a good nightâ€™s sleep. We had to settle it. 
Well, first of all, we ended up giving Chris one of the 
rooms, since he actually found the place and we were driving 
his car. It was a gift and Chris took it immediately, without 
a word, leaving Ty and I to fight over the remaining room. 
Well, we were through being nice guys. We both wanted that 
room bad. So we agreed to settle it the only way we knew

We ruled out celebrating each win with the ceremonial

. Whoever got four wins first got the good bed be-

cause it was game over. 
With that we dropped our bags, steadied our fists in front 
of us, and sized each other up, cracking our necks and loosen-
ing our shoulders for the big game. 
And so it began. 
I opened with rock, soundly shattering Tyâ€™s flimsy scis-
sors. Ty then countered with scissors again, falling once more 
to my sturdy rock. Then Ty switched gears to paper, but I was 
ready, this time employing his very own scissors to slice him 
to bits. Down 3â€“0 in a flash, Ty called for a quick pause. â€œI

square in the eye for a moment, squinted a bit, laughed, and 
then said, â€œAll right, Iâ€™m ready.â€ The next three rounds were 
a nightmarish blurâ€”his paper smothered my rock, his scis-

     <text><![CDATA[He quickly tied it up with that move, and so it all came 
down to the final toss. Before we threw our fists I peeked 
behind me at the open bedroom door, the setting sun casting 
warm shadows across the shiny silk bedspread, a flat-screen 
TV propped up on the wood dresser, a little loot bag of mini 
toiletries lying across the fluffy pillows. I looked and I 
dreamed and I drew . . . 
â€œAnd a one, two, three!â€ 
Ty took it with a quick slice of the scissors. 
I was left holding my open palm in my hands, wondering 
why I didnâ€™t go back to my faithful old rock. I could have 
shattered his scissors to smithereens, and I would have, too. I 
should have, too. But it never happened. 
Ty retreated gleefully to the private bedroom, slamming 
the door shut hard, sealing my mind-boggling loss with a 
brain-piercing bang. And so it was. Of course, I couldnâ€™t sleep 
that night. And it wasnâ€™t just because of the metal prongs 
stabbing my kidneys. It was because of the way I went 
down. 
But I canâ€™t blame the game. No, Rock-Paper-Scissors was 
there, settling an undebatable debate. It answered our big 
question, shutting the lid, closing the door, sealing the deal. 
You canâ€™t argue with Rock-Paper-Scissors. When itâ€™s over, itâ€™s 
really over. Sure, you can beg for that extension, but the vic-
tor never needs to take your bait. They played by the rules 
and they won.

My friend Allison was obsessed with The Last Taste. 
Sitting on the deck during a cookout, over at a friendâ€™s for 
a potluck, it didnâ€™t matter. â€œNo meal should end with any-
thing less than the best taste possible,â€ sheâ€™d say, while de-

the edge of her plate during the entire meal. â€œItâ€™s just not 
worth the risk.â€ 
I admit that at first I found it odd but over time began to 
admire her strong-willed ability to resist further nibbling. 
Me, I typically capped off a rich slice of cheesecake with a 
bite of a cold, tough dinner roll from an hour ago without 
even thinking about it. 
But not Allison. 
No, she didnâ€™t mask the last bite of a cold cut sub by pick-
ing at the stray ribbons of mustard-smeared lettuce lying on 
the tray. She didnâ€™t chase the sticky brownie paste stuck in 
her molars with a glass of  . And if we were 
watery skim milk
dining out in style, she wouldnâ€™t taste-test a bite of my din-
ner after she finished her own. â€œThereâ€™s no way that could

to keep tasting ravioli.â€

anyone could see. Chris of course adopted his Mexican half-

Over dinner one night my dad started telling me about his 
first day in Canada. 
It was 1968 and he was twenty-three, arriving on a plane 
eight dollars
with   in his pocket to start a new life by himself 
in a country he had never visited. 
â€œA community group had a welcome dinner for new im-
migrants,â€ he started excitedly. â€œAnd they had a big table of 
food!â€ 
I was unimpressed. 
â€œA table of food,â€ I agreed flatly while staring straight 
ahead and flipping past baseball highlights on TV. 
â€œA table of food,â€ he continued. â€œBasically, Neil, all the 
presentation of the picnic food on the table, I didnâ€™t recog-
nize. There were two or three kinds of salad. Potato salad, 
macaroni salad, maybe coleslaw. Probably four different kinds 
of sandwiches, ham sandwich, turkey sandwich, chicken 
sandwich, roast beef sandwich. Then there were the main 
courses they called it, you know, tuna casserole? Then the 
dessert was pies. Which I never seen pies before.â€ 
I put down the remote and glanced at him cockeyed. Behind 
the thick, boxy glasses, I could see his eyes darting wildly.

â€œMy brother was there, so I will ask him and he told me 
whatever it is. The trays of cold cuts was different, instead 
of regular chicken they have sliced them, sometimes they 
have them rolled with the toothpick in them. I had never 
seen cold cuts before, I seen chicken in chicken form but not 
rolled up. Same for cheese . . . some were in slices, some of 
them in squares.â€ 
â€œWhat did you eat?â€ I asked. 
â€œI ate everything, thatâ€™s the only way to get to know! I 
canâ€™t believe how many different things you can get here!â€ 
My dad would take me to the grocery store and marvel at 
the signs beside every fruit. He was fascinated that pineap-
ples came from Costa Rica and kiwis were shipped from New 
Zealand. Sometimes he came home and opened an atlas to 
find out where the countries were. â€œSomebody brought dates 
from Morocco and dropped them five minutes from home.â€ 
Heâ€™d just smile and shake his head. 
But if I really stop to think about it, a lot had to happen 
before we could be here right now. A lot had to happen be-
fore we could buy bananas from Ecuador and eat turkey cold 
cuts, before we could flip through books about warm under-
wear and cool pillows, before we learned to read anything at 
all, before we grew tall, before we could talk, before we could 
walk, before we were even born. . . .
So letâ€™s stop for a second and pull back. Letâ€™s pull way, way,

You used to be a sperm. 
Now donâ€™t get self-conscious. We all used to be sperm. 
Check out the period at the end of this sentence. That tiny 
little dot is around 600 microns wide. When you were a 
sperm, you were about 40 microns wide. And you were so 
little tail
cute back then too, with your   wagging all over the

fact, if you hadnâ€™t outswum your siblings, you might be a 
slightly different version of yourself right now. Maybe youâ€™d 
hairier arms
have a higher-pitched laugh,  , or stand two inches 
shorter. 
You had a great life as a sperm but always felt incomplete. 
The truth is you werenâ€™t whole until you met an egg. And 
then you two began a nine-month project to make a cool new 
version of you. It took a while but you grew arms and legs 
and eyeballs and lungs. You grew nerves and nails and ear-
drums and tongues. 
For a sperm to meet an egg it means your mom met your 
dad. But itâ€™s not just them. Think about how many people 
had to meet, fall in love, and make love for you to be here. 
a lot
Hereâ€™s the answer: a lot. Like   a lot. 
Before they had you, none of your ancestors drowned in 
a pond, got strangled by a python, or skied into a tree. None 
of your ancestors choked on a peach pit, was trampled by 
buffalo, or got their tie stuck in an assembly line.

I STEP OUT of the train and plunge into the narrow 
passageways of Shinagawa Station. Limescale on the walls, 
plasma screens ?ashing toothpaste ads, a  woman  with a 
gleaming smile. A tide of people rushing by. Outside, workmen 
are dismantling a building site. A platform overhangs a garden, 
cherry trees, enclosures where salarymen gather to smoke, 
pu?ing jerkily on their cigarettes, stubbing them out on rocks 
that look like the stones that horses lick for salt. 
I follow Madame Ogawa’s directions. Take the walkway that 
leads to the residential complex, building number 4488, buzz 
the answerphone to let her know I’ve arrived, take the lift up 
to the top ?oor. 
The door opens directly into the apartment. 
Madame Ogawa is dressed in a tailored jacket, sweatpants 
and socks. The heat is sti?ing. She looks older than I’d 
expected. Perhaps it’s because she’s so thin. She’s sent her 
daughter, Mieko, on an errand to the shops. She’ll show me 
round while we wait. 
A long corridor with rooms on either side, perfectly 
symmetrical. She shows me the bathroom ?rst. Fleshtoned 
plastic. So tiny I can barely stand. The bedroom opposite is just 
as small: built-in wardrobe, brown carpet. A bed with an 
immaculately ironed bedspread, a second one thrown across 
it, unironed, piled with a jumble of skirts and T-shirts. A stale 
tobacco smell hangs in the air. 
‘This used to be a hotel,’ Madame Ogawa says apologetically. 
‘We’re on the smoking ?oor here. We moved in when the hotel 
went bankrupt. My husband’s a bullet train engineer. He was 
working on the expansion of  Shinagawa Station for the 
Shinkansen trains. 
 The whole area’s being redeveloped. 
This’ll be a hotel again soon, they’re supposed to start 
work later this month. We’re  the only ones living here.’ 
She’s standing in the doorway, looking at me, her hand 
on the doorknob. I turn away, feeling uncomfortable in the 
intimacy of this cramped room with its bare light bulb. I 
can’t see any windows.

At the far end of the corridor, an open-plan living room with 
kitchen-diner. The stove takes up most of the room, along with 
the bookshelves. Beyond the picture window,  a haze of 
pollution blurs the contours of the metropolis below. 
I follow Madame Ogawa back towards the entrance. 
‘Mieko’s room is downstairs,’ she says, indicating a 
door half-hidden by a coat rack. The door opens onto a 
concrete staircase. ‘Be careful,’ she says. ‘The light switch is 
at the bottom of the stairs.’ 
Her voice echoes slightly, as if in a cave. I feel my way down 
until the concrete gives way to a springier surface underfoot. 
The humidity rises. A neon light ?ickers on to reveal an open 
pit surrounded by a walkway with a waist- high glass barrier. 
The ?oor of the pit slopes gently down to a drainage hole. In 
one corner sits a single bed. 
Madame Ogawa places her hands on the guard rail. ‘The 
swimming pool. It’s never been used, even when 
the hotel was open. Mould. It’s clean now, since we had it 
drained. Mieko sleeps here, for the time being.’ 
I lean over the barrier to get a better look. Arranged around 
the bed, a desk and a chest of drawers, a yoga mat and a hoop 
re?ected to in?nity in mirrors on either side of the pool. Plastic 
blocks are arranged at the foot of the steps leading down into 
the pool. I can’t help thinking of the arcade game Tetris, with 
the geometrical shapes that drop down and have to be 
arranged in space. 
‘Do you like yoga?’ Madame Ogawa asks. 
I tell her I don’t know, I’ve never tried it. She nods her head 
slowly. 
We go back upstairs. A little girl is waiting for us in the kitchen. 
Bobbed hair, shorts and a yellow T-shirt. She’s sweating, her 
fringe sticks to her forehead as she bows to greet me. 
‘I bought salmon,’ she says to her mother, holding up a 
package of ready-made lasagne. 
It’s only ten in the morning, but Mieko starts setting the 
table while her mother shucks oysters and puts the lasagne in 
the microwave.

It comes out steaming and she serves large portions to 
Mieko and me, a smaller one for herself. 
She’s taken o? her jacket. Her T-shirt clings to her ribs, the 
points of her nipples. A vein bulges along her arm from 
shoulder to wrist. Desiccated, I think to myself, like everything 
else about her. The lasagne sheets slither o? her chopsticks 
into the pink béchamel sauce. She ?shes them out again deftly. 
From time to time I bite into something that feels solid, the 
salmon probably. Mieko ?nishes eating and leans back in her 
chair, her mouth opening and closing like a ?sh. 
Madame Ogawa dabs at her lips with her napkin, folds it 
back up. 
‘If you could take her out once in a while too …’ 
‘Of course.’ 
‘I was thinking … Perhaps you could go and play ?rst?’ 
‘Okay.’ 
I’m not sure I’ve understood what she means by ‘play’. In 
Japanese, ‘play’ can be used for all sorts of things, from 
children’s games to evenings out with work colleagues. In 
Korean too. I’ve no idea what children like to do. I’m in my late 
twenties, I’m not used to being around  ten-year-olds.  I’m 
beginning to wish I hadn’t  answered that ad. ‘Native French 
speaker wanted in Tokyo to tutor ten-year-old during summer 
holidays.’ I’d seen the ad in Geneva, on Tokyo’s  Sophia 
University website. Madame Ogawa was a French teacher 
herself, she’d be busy preparing for the next school year. She 
didn’t want her daughter spending too much time on her own. 
I’d been planning to spend the month of August in Tokyo with 
my grandparents, before travelling to Korea with them at the 
beginning of September. I was concerned I might have too 
much time on my hands. I accepted Madame Ogawa’s o?er and 
we agreed that I’d meet up with Mieko now and then during 
my stay. 
Madame Ogawa cleans her plate and glances over at mine. 
‘You don’t like it. Have some oysters.’ 
‘No, no, it’s good,’ I say, forcing down a mouthful of lasagne. 
She clears away the lasagne plates and Mieko places an 
oyster in front of me.

The ?esh retracts, a small, viscous lump. I take a deep 
breath and gulp it down. 
Madame Ogawa seems satis?ed. She asks me where 
I’m staying. 
‘Not far from here,’ I reply, ‘ten stations further north on 
the Yamanote line, at my grandparents’ place.’ 
I pause. I feel awkward talking about my grandparents in 
Japanese. It makes them seem foreign somehow. I carry on 
talking, to compensate: 
‘They’re Korean,’ I say, ‘they live in Nippori. They run a 
pachinko parlour there. It’s only a small parlour, they’ve been 
running it for ?fty years, ever since they arrived here.’ 
Mieko leans in towards the table, her lips closed. Madame 
Ogawa nods, a look of concern on her face, just as when I said 
I didn’t do yoga. I can understand her reservations. Here in 
Japan, pachinko machines are seen as no di?erent from casino 
slot machines. Everyone plays  pachinko, but it’s still 
disapproved  of.  Pachinko parlours have their own banking 
system, with a reputation for funding the main political parties 
under the counter. They advertise all over the media, feeding a 
whole parallel economy. But that’s only the big chains like 
Diamond  or  Merrytale. Not small businesses like my 
grandfather’s. 
 
When we’ve ?nished eating, Madame Ogawa goes down to the 
pool, and Mieko sets her things out on the table. 
‘Aren’t we going down to your room?’ I ask. ‘No, 
my mother’s there.’ 
She calls me sensei, teacher in Japanese. I tell her to call me 
by my name, Claire, but it’s hard for her to say; she pronounces 
it Calairo, so I ask her to use the Korean for big sister, onni. 
‘Onni,’ she murmurs as if she’s trying to commit it to 
memory. 
Her homework is clearly set out in a notebook. Today’s topic 
is agreement of French adjectives. I’m not sure of her level, so 
I read the examples aloud for her, thinking what a dull 
textbook this is, colourless, with no pictures. Mieko knows it 
all perfectly, giving the answers before I can ask the questions.

‘What’s the point of me being here?’ I ask her. 
‘We’ve practised it,’ she says. 
‘Practised?’ 
‘Yes, because you were coming.’ 
I think back to the meal we’ve just had, how everything she 
and her mother did was perfectly synchronised. 
I watch her working through the exercises for a few 
moments and then leave her to get on with it. I walk over to 
the picture window, look down at the station; a central spine, 
four walkways fanning out like limbs. A lizard lying in wait. 
Buildings everywhere, overhead wires stretching into the 
distance, all the way to Mount Fuji, barely visible through the 
smog. 
I scan the bookshelves. Rousseau, Chateaubriand. Essays on 
literature, Swiss Romantics. History books. The  French 
Revolution. I have the feeling these books don’t contain the 
history I learnt at school; these volumes tell of another parallel 
history, one that played out simultaneously on another planet. 
Around one o’clock, Madame Ogawa comes back up with some 
royal milk tea and kkwabaegi, Korean doughnuts, from the 
Family Mart for us. The bodysuit she’s wearing reveals every 
fold and pleat of her body. 
After she’s gone back down, I ask Mieko why her mother wears 
shoes inside the apartment. Japanese people usually take them 
o? indoors. 
‘She says she needs to hear her own footsteps. I’m not 
supposed to tell anyone.’ 
We sit side by side munching our snacks. The label on the 
bottle of tea has a picture of Donald Duck and Daisy in their 
swimsuits, at the beach. A special summer o?er. Of course, 
Disneyland Tokyo. I could take Mieko there. I’m not sure she’d 
like it, maybe amusement parks aren’t her thing. 
‘Is there anywhere in particular you’d like me to take you 
while I’m here?’ 
She  looks  up  at  the  ceiling,   then  at  me,   goes  to  say  
something, hesitates, sits up straight and eventually says she 
doesn’t really mind, it’s up to me.

I feel vaguely annoyed. You’re not much help, I think to 
myself. 
When she’s ?nished the worksheets, she asks me what she 
has to do next. I haven’t prepared  anything.  I  make up an 
exercise to keep her busy for a while. 
 
I’m still feeling jet-lagged. Sitting on the sofa I have a hard 
time staying awake. There’s  not enough ventilation,  the 
windows are steamed up, the room feels cramped. I’m bigger 
and bulkier than Mieko and her mother. If I’m not careful I 
might break something. 
 
Walking me back to the lift, Madame Ogawa hands me an 
envelope and thanks me. She seems relieved that my visit is 
over. She’s wearing a robe, her hair is wet. I haven’t said 
goodbye to Mieko, she hasn’t ?nished the worksheet. But the 
door slides shut. 
 
I spend the train journey back to Nippori trying to dislodge a 
piece of kkwabaegi, stuck between my teeth. By the time I 
manage to work it free my tongue has started to bleed.

I ARRIVE at my grandparents’ place to ?nd my grandmother 
seated on the ?oor in the living  room  surrounded by her 
Playmobil ?gures. She’s removed  all  their  hair. They smile 
vacantly. 
‘Where’ve you been?’ 
I don’t answer, irritated by the whining tone she  adopts 
whenever I come in. She knows perfectly well where I’ve been. 
She roots around in the pile of  Playmobil wigs, pulls out one 
with a long braid and one with a bun, sets them on the heads 
of two female ?gures and holds them up to her ears, shaking 
them. 
‘Which one do you like best? I have to go to the 
hairdresser’s.’ 
I take a good look at her. Long nose, rounded belly, like a 
baby seal. 
‘The bun.’ 
‘Will you come with me?’ 
I call out yes from the kitchen. I put some water on to boil 
for the rice, soak the black beans. We’ll eat when my 
grandfather gets home, at half past eight, after the pachinko 
parlour closes. He’s ninety years old but he still goes every day, 
from dawn to dusk. I go back to the living room, open the 
window to let out the steam. 
 
Nippori. Pale green, to match the green of the Yamanote line 
trains that slice through the neighbourhood on their elevated 
rails. Korean restaurants, Chinese noodles, sumo stables, the 
vast  Yanaka  cemetery up on the hill. And the pachinko 
parlours. Diamond and Merrytale on the street that goes to 
Nishi-Nippori; Shiny, my grandfather’s, on the street leading to 
Uguisudani. 
Our duplex is wedged between two tower blocks, across the 
street from the Shiny. You can see it from the kitchen and 
living-room windows, the gaudy front paintedin red and white, 
like a clown’s face. Now and then, the doors open to suck 
players in or spit them out with the smoke.

Shiny. 
Not so shiny though, especially when you compare it with a 
Diamond or Merrytale. To attract customers, my grandfather 
employs a sandwich-board woman. She must be about my age. 
She stands on the corner by the taxi rank, at the foot of the 
steps leading up to the station, her two boards sporting the 
Shiny’s colours clamped to her body. Her monotonous chant 
blends in with the piped music from the Family Mart, the 
convenience store next door, open twenty-four hours a day. 
And then there’s Yuki, scrawny and round-shouldered, in his 
pink sweater. The professional player hired to stand outside the 
Shiny in the morning, waiting for it to come  to life. As soon as 
the doors open, he makes straight for the machine nearest the 
window. The idea is to create an impression of plenty. Come in, 
his presence says, inside the Shiny, things are buzzing. 
At the front desk, the security guard with his surveillance 
cameras. A local policeman, retired. The Japanese government 
doesn’t provide pensions for its employees. Men without 
savings or family to look after them in their old age have to go 
on working until the end of their lives. There aren’t many 
pachinko parlours that don’t have a retired policeman in 
charge of security.

WE EAT sitting on the ?oor at the low table in the living room. 
My grandfather raises his spoon slowly to his mouth, his hand 
shaking. Finally, he sucks in the contents in one gulp, as if the 
food he’s carried so laboriously to his lips might evaporate. 
From time to time, he puts down his spoon and pours himself a 
glass of soju. He concentrates intently, his grip unsteady, but 
nothing spills. My grandmother leans over towards her bowl, 
slurping her food with gusto. 
She looks up occasionally and asks me in English, ‘Is good? 
Is good?’ 
‘Ye, mashissoyo,’ I mumble in Korean, ‘yes, it’s good.’ 
I sit facing them, trying to eat as slowly as my grandfather, 
delaying that moment at the end of the meal when a heavy 
silence descends. 
They haven’t mentioned our trip to Korea once since I 
arrived. We need to make plans, start buying tickets. I don’t 
know how to raise the subject. I used to be able to speak 
Korean but I lost it when French became my main language. 
My grandfather used to correct my mistakes, but not any more. 
We communicate in simple English, with a few basic words in 
Korean and an array of gestures and exaggerated facial 
expressions. We never speak in Japanese. 
When they turn on the television, I feign tiredness and go 
downstairs to my room. The staircase is narrow, like the one at 
Mieko’s, except that here the ?oors are made of wood, the 
walls covered in mustard-coloured ?ock. My room is next to the 
bathroom. My grandparents use it to store bedding and extra 
tatami mats. When I was little the rolled-up bamboo mats 
standing sentinel in the half- light would appear in my dreams, 
transformed into giant  grasshoppers.  The room is simply 
furnished. A bed, a desk, a few boxes of my mother’s things. 
On top of one of the boxes is our old Monopoly set, the Swiss 
edition my mother bought to give her parents an idea of where 
we live.

     <text><![CDATA[ 
On the table by the bed iss a photo of my grandmother aged 
about  ten,  with  plump  cheeks  and  round  belly,  taken  just  
 
before the Second World War. Her mother stands behind her, 
one hand on her shoulder. Dressed in the traditional white 
linen costume, they pose proudly. It was rare for women to 
have their picture taken in Seoul in those days. Over the years 
the white of their costume has taken on a dull tinge, a yellowish 
hue that speaks of mourning in both Korea and Japan. 
I lie on the bed, wriggle out of my clothes. My feet protrude 
beyond the end of the bed. It’s too hot. The polyester sheets 
cling to my stomach. In the end, I unroll one of the tatami mats, 
cover it with a sheet and lie on the ground, trying to ?nd a cool 
spot. 
Noises drift in from the street. Car exhausts, heels on the 
tarmac, and all night long, the sandwich-board woman’s 
monotonous chant, relayed on playback through a 
loudspeaker. 
The window is at street height. Lying on the ground, I can 
see people’s legs as they hurry past, heading for the narrow 
streets of Uguisudani, where the love hotels are. I’ve never 
been inside one. I can’t help thinking about the girls who work 
there, the men in grey suits. Most of the girls are much 
younger than I am. 
I picture the street. I know every inch of it, I’ve walked down 
it so often on my way to Ueno Park. The Schall, with its cut-out 
black bat on the roof. The Transatlantic. The Mont Blanc, with 
its jacuzzis. The Dream. Further along, you come to the bento 
box stall with its panda- shaped scales, walk over the bridge 
above the railway lines, pass the man in his makeshift canvas 
shelter, skirt along the cemetery as far as the whale statue in 
front of the Natural History Museum, and eventually arrive at 
Ueno Park. Starbucks, the University of the Arts, then the zoo. 
Through the ceiling, I hear my grandmother laughing. 
I open my laptop and check my emails. My  friends gave up 
writing to me ages ago, I took too long to reply.  Mathieu 
probably has too weak a signal. He’s house- sitting a chalet in 
Val d’Anniviers, writing up his thesis. And my mother? Has she 
messaged me? She usually keeps me up to date on where my

father’s been playing. He’s an organist.  
 
She sends me lists of the churches, chapels, cathedrals he’s 
played in: Porrentruy, Zürich, Rheinau, Solothurn, Zollikon, 
Fribourg. She never gives me the programme, only the venue. 
I picture them both, dots on the map, hopping from town to 
village. How easy it seems for them. Ever since I came to Japan 
I’ve felt drained of all energy. Sometimes when I read my 
mother’s messages, I feel so exhausted I abandon whatever it 
was I was planning to do and stretch out on the bed, arms and 
legs spread, like a star?sh. 
She hasn’t written. 
My laptop starts making a loud whirring noise. I shut it down 
and become aware of the darkness. The silence in the house. I 
can’t hear the television any more, nor my grandmother’s 
laugh. Only the distant cry of the sandwich-board woman. I 
close my eyes and let sleep wash over me.

THREE DAYS have gone by. I’ve changed my mind about 
taking Mieko to Disneyland. All children love places like that. 
I’d have gone there myself with my grandmother when I was 
Mieko’s age, but my mother was against it. She didn’t consider 
it appropriate. 
 
I head towards Nippori  station. It’s rained in the night, a 
monsoon downpour, although Japan’s monsoon season is 
supposed to be over. The temperature has stalled, several 
degrees above the average for this time of year. 
The sandwich-board woman smells of wet clothes. Her 
boards are limp and waterlogged. She’s stepped back under 
the awning, out of the rain, but still visible from  the sidewalk. 
Her hair is matted. She ?xes her gaze straight ahead, the 
microphone in her hand. It’s supposed to be attached to her 
cap. The elastic must have gone. I make a mental note to 
mention it to my grandfather. 
It’s not quite time for my train. I go into the Family Mart, 
stop in front of the packaged pastries, try to get a clearer 
image of the contents obscured by the logos all over the 
packaging. I can see someone squinting at the yoghurts in the 
chilled section. Pink sweater. Yuki. I ran into him here this 
morning too. He comes in by the back entrance, through the 
glass door that connects with the Shiny. 
Most players at this time of day are women; they come while 
their children are at school, or on summer programmes, and 
their husbands are at work. The older people, retirees, come 
mostly in the afternoon. Early in the evening, the machines are 
taken over by salarymen and sumo wrestlers. 
Yuki selects a choco-mint doughnut and goes back to the 
Shiny. The door slides open; a blast of loud music, rapid-?re 
salvos of pachinko balls. People say the name pachinko comes 
from the noise the balls make in the machine, pinging against 
the glass, swooshing through the plastic tubes, clanking 
against the bumpers, the shriek of metal, the ?nal clang as they 
fall into the tray.

     <text><![CDATA[ 
The door slides shut. 
Silence. 
Yuki takes his seat at his usual machine, rips the wrapping 
from the doughnut, eats it with one hand, the other hand 
poised on the lever. He gazes out of the window. 
The rules are simple. The player sits in front of the upright 
pachinko machine and feeds money in. Balls come spurting up, 
thousands of metal balls – spraying, tumbling and bouncing o? 
a series of obstacles, all the way down to the bottom of the 
vertical playing ?eld, then vanishing into one of three holes. 
Balls that fall into the middle hole come back out in a cart on 
the outside of the machine. Players can exchange them for 
prizes at the end of the session, the prize lots determined by 
the number of balls. 
The only control a player has over the machine is to adjust 
the force at which the balls are ejected by slowly turning a 
knob that ?ts into the palm of the hand. The knob turns both 
ways. There’s not much else for players to do. Some jam the 
knob into position with a coin, leaving their hands free so they 
can smoke. The experienced players keep one hand on the 
handle. That way they can stay in control, sense the slightest 
hitch, tweak the handle in response or relax the ?ngers a little. 
The smallest of movements, almost imperceptible, can 
in?uence the outcome. They stay focused, ignoring the ?ashing 
lights, the other players, the cigarette burning down, the wail 
of the piped music and the din of the three hundred pachinko 
machines in my grandfather’s gaming hall. At a quarter past 
eight, I buy some plums and a couple of doughnuts, walk to the 
station, the sandwich-board woman’s cry in my ears: 
‘Shiny and bright, shiny and bright, shiny Shiny every night 
…’

DOMED BLUE CEILING, a phantom ocean. The Little Mermaid 
hangs from a wire, waving her hands in greeting, her tail 
swishing sinuously in her wake. Her stomach bulges from the 
harness beneath her bodysuit. Down on the ground, visitors 
brandish cameras, contorting themselves to keep her in their 
sights. A pu? of smoke and Triton, king of the waves, surges 
forth. A robot, not a living actor like the mermaid. His voice 
booms out a warning to his daughter: ‘Moray eels.’ Ariel 
screams, another pu? of smoke, she spins one last time and 
disappears. Darkness. 
 
Outside, it’s raining again. 
‘Did you like that?’ I ask Mieko, nervously. 
‘Yes.’ 
Minnie Mouse is handing out ponchos and pink umbrellas. 
People are starting to line the main street. Clustered together, 
all swathed in plastic, they remind me of bubble wrap. 
‘What are we waiting for?’ I  ask Mieko, realising we’ve 
joined the expectant crowd. 
‘The parade.’ 
She’s too far back to be able to see anything. 
‘Do you want to stand in front of me?’ I ask. ‘I 
don’t mind.’ 
I ask her what she’d like to do. She scans the scene. I 
suggest It’s a Small World, there’s no queue there at the 
moment. She pulls a face. 
What about the Haunted Mansion? Another grimace. 
‘Peter Pan’s Flight?’ 
‘Okay.’ 
I suspect she’s only saying yes to please me. 
‘Or something else, if you prefer.’ 
‘No, that’s ?ne.’ 
 
We ?y over London, the city set out beneath us, children’s 
bedrooms, Big Ben displaying midnight. It’s warm and clammy 
in our pirate ship, there’s a smell of sweat.

I try not to touch any surfaces. The seat belt is loose on 
Mieko, even when it’s pulled tight. I can’t see the expression 
on her face. When we get to the pirates’ island, I make a show 
of laughing at Captain Hook, oohing and aahing exaggeratedly 
until suddenly we pick up speed and I’m ?ung against Mieko. 
She turns and gives me a slightly condescending smile. For the 
rest of the ride, I cling to the edge of the seat. 
 
When we emerge it’s raining even harder. We wait it out in the 
souvenir shop. A father with his two sons. He tells them they 
can each choose a soft toy. Australian accent. He reminds me 
of Mathieu, with that sweater, the orange anorak. Mathieu has 
started talking about children lately. There don’t seem to be 
many here. It’s mostly young couples. The man smiles at me, 
he’s seen me looking at him. He must think I’m a parent too. I 
look away. 
Mieko is examining the Minnie Mouse ears. 
‘Would you like a pair of ears?’ I ask. 
She shakes her head. Does she want a drink? No. I adjust 
my poncho. I’m thirsty. I need something to drink. I tell her to 
wait for me here. 
 
I cross the road, make for a café inside Ali Baba’s Cavern. 
Minnie Mouse is there too, on a break. She’s removed the head 
of her costume, the big hands. I sip my drink slowly, relieved 
to be away from Mieko. I want her to enjoy herself. Have some 
fun. I feel like tugging at her ear, pinching her cheek and 
pleading directly into her ear: please, Mieko, please have fun. 
The Australian has followed me. He’s seated the boys at a 
table near mine and gone to give their order.  A waitress 
approaches him, hands him a menu in English, passes one to 
the French couple too, and to those young Chinese girls. I 
wasn’t o?ered one, people think I’m Japanese. But I’ve never 
felt more foreign than I have this summer, with this child at my 
side. 
The father comes back with a tray of cinnamon rolls. His 
children fall on them hungrily. I scurry away to rejoin Mieko.

I ?nd her stroking a Bambi ?gurine. ‘Do 
you like Bambi?’ I ask hopefully. She 
nods. 
‘Would you like me to buy it for you?’ 
‘No, that’s okay.’ 
‘I’ll give it to you as a gift. I’d like to.’ 
‘But I don’t want it. His mother’s dead and his father goes 
away somewhere at the end, and we don’t know where he’s 
gone.’ 
‘That’s because he’s old. He goes away to die.’ ‘I 
know that,’ she says scathingly. 
Snippets of the story come back to me. It wasn’t my 
favourite Disney tale, I found it irritating, the timid little fawn 
afraid of his own shadow. 
‘I don’t want it!’ she says again as I head towards the 
cash desk with the ?gurine. 
‘I’m buying it for my grandmother.’ 
She stares at me in disbelief. I ?nish paying and stu? the 
?gurine into the bottom my bag, holding it close under my arm 
to keep it out of the rain. Mieko hasn’t taken her eyes o? me. 
‘It’s just to remind her of when I was little,’ I say, thinking 
of the evenings my grandmother and I used to spend together 
watching the videos I brought with me from Switzerland – The 
Lion King,  The Little Mermaid,  Sleeping Beauty –  it was 
something we both enjoyed. 
‘All children play with their grandmothers …’ ‘I 
didn’t,’ she mutters, eyes cast down. 
I try and make amends. I wasn’t exactly playing with my 
grandmother, I say, it was more a way of being together, and 
besides, I didn’t see her very often, only during the holidays, 
and my grandfather was always working at the pachinko 
parlour, from morning till night. 
‘The pachinko parlour,’ Mieko says, interrupting me. ‘That’s 
where I’d like to go.’ 
I laugh. Does she even know what a pachinko parlour is? 
She rolls her eyes. Obviously, everyone knows about pachinko 
parlours, they’re everywhere. She’s never been inside one. 
That’s what she wants to do with me.

‘They’re not for children you know, it’s not a children’s 
game.’ 
‘I know.’ 
She stares at me earnestly. I doubt my grandfather would 
object to me showing her round the Shiny. It’d certainly be less 
bother and much less expensive than coming all this way out 
of the city to Disneyland. Even so, I don’t want to make any 
promises. 
‘If you like, one day … Maybe we could, yes.’ 
Mieko smiles. At long last, I think to myself, she looks like a 
normal kid. 
 
In  the restaurant in the Star Wars  section, Mieko orders 
omurice and I have a raspberry tart. We sit by the window. The 
parade is in full ?ow. Ariel, Cinderella, Minnie Mouse, Mickey 
Mouse and Donald Duck ?le past, one by one, waving their 
arms in the air to the jolly music and lip-syncing the words to 
‘Happiness Is Here’, all jigging about, even the actors (slaves 
perhaps?) tethered to Aladdin’s ?oat. On every face the same 
tightly 
stretched grin, the same vacant, happy look. 
Mieko goes on eating, paying them no attention. ‘Is 
that good?’ 
‘It’s ?lling.’ 
I look down at my tart. A single raspberry glistens atop a 
lump of whipped cream. Compact and rubbery-looking. I pick 
up my knife, cut the tart into sections and start eating. It tastes 
fatty. I spit it out into my napkin. The raspberry stares up at 
me, still intact, coated in a ?lm of jelly.

MY GRANDFATHER is spooning his food into his mouth faster 
than usual. He spills some soju, pushes away the napkin I o?er 
him. My grandmother has already left the table and is sitting 
on the sofa pretending to read a magazine. She went missing 
yesterday, while I was out at Disneyland. She set o? by train 
for Shin-Okubo, where the Korean shops are, in search of long 
noodles. She didn’t recognise the station and stayed on the 
train, going round and round on the Yamanote line over and 
over again. My grandfather assumed I was with her. I called 
the police as soon as I got home. You need to wait for a while, 
they said, old people are unpredictable, they often act on a 
whim. In the end, a Japan Railways employee brought her back 
home; he’d found her in one of the seats reserved for elderly 
people, asleep. 
‘All that for a few noodles,’ my grandfather grumbles. ‘I’ll 
go with her next time,’ I say under my breath. 
‘I can go by myself,’ my grandmother protests. 
Looking at them, I feel overwhelmed. Their lives begin and 
end with the pachinko parlour. The only social interactions 
they have are to do with exchanging balls for trinkets: one 
hundred balls, a bottle of water; one thousand balls, a bar of 
chocolate; ten thousand balls, an electric razor; no balls, a pack 
of chewing gum, the consolation prize. They don’t socialise at 
all with other Zainichis, Japan’s Korean community: exiles, 
people who came, as my grandparents did, to escape the 
Korean war, and others, who were deported during the 
Japanese occupation of Korea. 
‘We need to organise things for the trip,’ I say tentatively, 
almost to myself. ‘I still haven’t booked our tickets.’ 
My grandfather complains that he can’t leave the pachinko 
parlour in the middle of the season. I remind him  that  we’d 
planned  to  go  for  one  week  only,  at  the  beginning of 
September. He’ll think it over, he says. We can discuss it again 
tomorrow. It’s time for the service. And slipping into a well-
established routine, my grandparents push the co?ee table to 
one side and place two cushions in front of the television set 
tuned to KBS World, the Korean channel that broadcasts the 
weekly church service.

 They sit cross-legged on the ?oor, Bibles in hand, following 
along attentively. When it’s time for  the hymns they both join 
in the singing, my grandmother’s voice strong and full, my 
grandfather’s a wavering vibrato. My grandmother looks up, 
lost; my grandfather helps her ?nd her place, keeping time 
with his index ?nger. They’re completely absorbed, unaware of 
my presence. 
On the table, our three bowls make the shape of a face. My 
grandparents’, the two eyes; mine, the mouth, rounded as if in 
astonishment. I clear them away and get on with the washing 
up. When I’ve ?nished, I help  myself  to a beer and go 
downstairs to my room. I’ll have to stop doing this soon. I can’t 
go on using jet lag as an excuse for knocking myself out like 
this for much longer. 
 
My mother has messaged me. My birthday is still two weeks 
away but she wanted to make sure I read this in time. They 
love me lots, I’m their pet, their little chicken, they send me 
hugs. 
There’s an audio attachment. A clip from a radio 
programme, a recording of the classical music festival in 
Verbier. An organ solo, in a church. A piece I don’t know. The 
last few bars. A pause. People clap, the organ strikes up again. 
It’s playing ‘Happy Birthday’. The commentator is surprised, 
mumbles something about it apparently being someone’s 
birthday today, urges everyone to celebrate with the unknown 
person. The applause grows louder. Someone shouts: ‘Hooray.’ 
There’s a picture with the message. My father, at the organ, 
photographed from behind, my mother in the foreground, a 
sel?e. She’s smiling, features distorted by the perspective: 
double chin, mouth enlarged, forehead shrunk. 
I take a good look at the picture. Swipe it away quickly to 
save it. 
I have a message from Mathieu too. He’s in the village, he’s 
come down the mountain to send me this message. He says he 
misses me, he thinks I’d like the chalet, you can lie in bed and 
gaze at the Dent Blanche. Has my grandfather managed to 
reduce his hours?

He’s concerned about my grandmother’s health. He’s 
thinking of us, sends them his love. 
I feel reassured by the tone of his message. He’s not angry 
with me after our parting words at the airport. He’d said not to 
worry, if I had any problems at all he’d come straight over, I 
could count on him. I’d snapped at him, said they were my 
grandparents, not his, insisted everything would be ?ne and 
gone through security without looking back. 
But it was his caring nature that had attracted me to him in 
the ?rst place, when I was in his Japanese seminar class at 
Geneva  University.  From the start, Mathieu  had  tried to 
understand the reason for my lack of enthusiasm. I told him it 
was Korean I really wanted to study, but to do that, I’d have to 
go to Berlin, London, Paris. I couldn’t do it in Switzerland. I 
never went, I couldn’t imagine being so far away from home. I 
fell back on Japanese, telling myself it would make my visits to 
my grandparents easier. 
‘You can learn Korean later,’ Mathieu used to say. 
It was all so easy for him. My grandparents spoke Japanese 
with him. We went to see them together twice. His presence 
masked the di?iculties I had in communicating. Mathieu would 
spend whole days with my grandmother. I’d go for walks all 
over  the  neighbourhood while they were together.  I  felt 
relieved, but I was jealous too. He’d report their conversations 
to me in the evenings, in this room; they talked  mostly about 
their life in Korea, before, under Japanese occupation. 
‘They made it illegal to speak Korean. You  could be 
sentenced to death for speaking it. And do you know  what your 
grandmother’s mother did to avoid being subjected to speaking 
Japanese at school? She sliced o? part of her own tongue.’ 
I didn’t know.  I knew almost nothing about my 
grandparents’ past. They didn’t talk about it with me or my 
mother. I knew they’d come to Japan by sea in 1952 to escape 
the civil war in Korea when they were eighteen and nineteen 
years old, my grandmother pregnant with my mother. They’d 
heard rumours of a ?ourishing industry in Japan, run by 
Zainichis. There was nothing in the way of entertainment in 
those post-war days: no cinema, no theatre. The black market 
was everywhere, with cigarettes the most prized commodity.

Koreans were locked out of the Japanese labour market by 
virtue of their nationality. So, they invented a game: vertical 
tray, metal balls, a lever. And cigarettes in exchange for balls. 
It was Mathieu who explained to me how important 
pachinko became to the Japanese economy. In 1953,  while 
Korea was tearing itself apart, its people ?eeing to wherever 
they could, there were almost four hundred thousand pachinko 
parlours in Japan. Interest waned during the 1960s when other 
forms of entertainment began to expand, but even now there 
are still more than  twenty thousand pachinko parlours in 
Japan, all run exclusively by Zainichis and their descendants. 
Mathieu found it surprising that in all those years of exile, 
my grandparents had never returned to Korea. I remember, 
when I was little, hearing them say they’d go 
back one day. Now that they’d reached such a great age, we 
decided it would be best for us to take them there. It was up to 
Mathieu to speak to them about it. He said they seemed keen, 
and we booked our ?ights to  Tokyo.  Korea was unfamiliar 
territory for both of us and we were planning to make all the 
other arrangements once we arrived in Tokyo. But as the time 
approached, Mathieu realised he still had a great deal of work 
to do to ?nish his thesis. Eventually he decided to pull out of 
the trip, but he encouraged me to go without him. I couldn’t 
see myself reading his drafts on the family unit in Japan during 
the twelfth century – I’d just ?nished working on a second 
Master’s degree myself. So, I came to Tokyo on my own. 
 
Footsteps on the stairs. I’d left my door open. My grandfather 
walks past my room, in his pyjamas, waves hello, goes into the 
bathroom. He’s probably seen the beer. I close the door, turn 
o? the light, lie down on the ?oor. I start a game of Tetris on 
my phone. The screen ?ashes in the darkness. Headlights from 
passing cars light up the room intermittently. I think about the 
photo  of my parents again, my mother’s message. Me as their 
little chicken. I picture myself running round in circles, 
banging into things, falling over. Clucking. I try not to giggle.

I FIND MIEKO sitting in a corner of the empty pool, arms 
wrapped round her knees, gazing despondently at an upturned 
plastic bowl. She’s not moving at all, except for her lips, which 
are opening and closing, making a gentle popping sound, like 
a bubble bursting. There’s a bee under the bowl; she found it 
buzzing around the pool a few days ago. She trapped it, afraid 
it might sting her, and now she’s scared of looking under the 
bowl. 
I lift it carefully. 
The bee is stuck to the rim of the bowl, dried out. I give it a 
shake. It slips o? and as it hits the ground, its wings and legs 
fall o?. 
‘I’m horrible,’ Mieko wails. 
I place my hand on her shoulder. 
‘These things happen …’ 
‘You don’t understand,’ she retorts. ‘I wanted it to die. 
I wanted it dead. I’m a horrible person.’ 
She taps her head feebly against the side of the pool, 
saying over and over again that she’s horrible, horrible. 
 
I go back up to the bathroom and ?ush the dead creature down 
the toilet. Watching it whirl around the bowl it occurs to me 
that I’m used to seeing bees in Switzerland. But not here. 
Where did it come from? 
 
When  I  come  back  down,  Mieko  is  lying  ?at  on  her 
stomach on the bed, completely still, her face buried in the 
pillow, hidden beneath her helmet of black hair. The 
thought that she might be dead ?ashes through my mind. ‘You 
think this room is weird,’ she blurts out, her voice 
mu?ed by the pillow. 
‘What?’ 
She turns and looks up, red-faced.

‘You look at it like you think it’s weird.’ 
I try and deny it but she says she hates it too, and I 
immediately regret lying to her. 
‘Can you swim?’ I ask. 
She says she wishes she’d learnt, but her mother thinks the 
water in swimming pools isn’t clean, it’s full of bacteria, it’s not 
good for your digestion. I say she’s not missing much, I’ve 
never really liked swimming. 
‘You don’t like pachinko too,’ she says. ‘You don’t like 
anything.’ 
‘Pachinko either. We say “either”. And that’s not what I said. 
It’s not true that I don’t like anything.’ 
‘Why aren’t we going there?’ 
‘We will,’ I say. 
‘When?’ 
‘Soon.’ 
‘Promise?’ 
‘I promise,’ I say unconvincingly. 
I set today’s lesson out on the desk. This time I’ve prepared 
the exercises. Mieko says she’s hungry and I produce the 
plums and kkwabaegi I bought at the Family Mart from my 
bag. 
‘Doughnuts!’ she exclaims. ‘My favourite!’ 
She breaks open a plum and plants it on a doughnut. It 
looks like a stick ?gure sitting cross-legged. 
‘Me, with fair hair,’ she says waving it about next to her face. 
‘Stop it, you look like my grandmother.’ 
She bursts out laughing, says she can’t wait to meet her. 
‘I’m not sure we’ll be able to do that,’ I say cautiously. 
‘Why? When we go to the pachinko parlour …’ 
‘She’s never there. It’s only my grandfather. She stays at 
home. Whenever she goes out, she gets lost.’ 
‘Why? Doesn’t she know her way around?’ ‘She’s 
old. And no, Tokyo isn’t really her home.’ 
Mieko purses her lips, a sign that she’s processing  this. My 
grandmother wouldn’t like the idea of this meeting at all, I 
think to myself. She’d have to speak Japanese.

‘Did she like your Bambi gift?’ Mieko asks. 
I mumble yes, ask her if she has any coloured felt-tips, 
I can’t ?nd any in her desk drawers. 
‘You know,’ she says, ‘I saw some fawns once. In Miyajima. 
There are loads of them wandering about, but people feed 
them and they’re getting a bit stupid and starting to die. 
They’re forgetting how to ?nd food for themselves. Or else they 
get diabetes.’ 
Miyajima. The island famous for its shrine at the water’s 
edge, with the red gates that seem to ?oat on the water at high 
tide. Mathieu had wanted to go there, but we ended up just 
staying at my grandparents’ place. 
‘I went there by train with my daddy. We were right up front 
with the driver. My dad was checking to see everything was 
working properly – he designed the train. I never fed the deer. 
But there was still one that followed me. Everywhere I went, 
even in the morning outside the hotel, it’d been waiting for me 
all night.’ 
I tease her, was it really the same one? With so many  of 
them, how could she be sure? She looks taken aback, her eyes 
well up. 
‘I was only joking,’ I say quickly. She 
props herself up on her elbows. 
‘One day I’ll have a real bedroom. But we can’t leave while 
Daddy’s still not here.’ 
‘Where is he?’ 
‘Don’t you know? He got on a train one day and he’s never 
come back.’ 
I turn and look at her. She’s ?ung herself back down onto 
the mattress. I think back to what I said to her at Disneyland, 
about Bambi, his father going away to die. 
‘I’m so sorry, Mieko. I had no idea.’ 
She says it doesn’t matter, it happened a long time 
ago. And then adds: 
‘But if we’re not here when he comes back, how would 
he ever ?nd us?’ 
She  sighs,  a  long  exhale  that  turns  into  a  hissing 
sound. I feel awkward and suggest we do some work.

‘What does your dad do?’ she asks. 
I tell her about the organ, the teaching, the church services, 
the concerts. Mieko listens attentively, asks how an organ 
works. I can’t explain, I don’t really know much about it. 
Rather tersely, I say: 
‘Come along now. We have work to do.’ 
She drags herself over to the desk. 
 
Instead of working from Mieko’s book we practise a dialogue 
I’ve made up. I couldn’t face the Japanese manual so I scoured 
my memory for inspiration and came up with a simple 
conversation between a girl and a boy. I’ve sketched them in 
felt-tips. I start: 
‘Hello, Carol, I’m Martin. Do you want to play with me?’ 
‘Why not?’ Mieko replies. 
I try not to laugh. Her voice has a nasal twang when 
she speaks French. It makes me feel less intimidated. 
‘All right, come on then! What shall we play?’ I 
stare at her, waiting for her to reply: 
‘Go on,’ I say. ‘Your turn.’ 
She  frowns,  says  I’ve  just  stolen  her  line.  I  say  it 
doesn’t matter. 
‘So am I supposed to be the girl now?’ she asks. 
‘The girl or the boy. It’s all the same.’ 
She ?ings herself against the back of her chair. 
‘I can’t.’ 
‘You’re doing ?ne. Go on, read it.’ 
She stares at me. ‘You’re not really a teacher anyway.’ 
‘French is my ?rst language.’ 
‘I thought it was Japanese.’ 
‘Of course it isn’t. How could it be? My great- grandmother 
sliced o? her tongue so she wouldn’t have to speak Japanese!’ 
I stick out my tongue and make a cutting motion: ‘Like this. 
With a knife.’ 
‘That must hurt,’ Mieko says, grimacing. 
‘Must have hurt. She’s dead.’

I give her a stern look. She sets to work, and I sit on the bed 
in her spot. I shouldn’t have lost my temper like that. She’s too 
young to understand, it has nothing to do with her. We agree to 
give up on manuals and exercises and just chat instead, in 
French or in Japanese, whatever we feel like. 
‘You  won’t tell your mother?’ 
‘Yes, I won’t tell.’ 
 
We spend the rest of the afternoon playing Tetris on my phone. 
I can’t concentrate. I keep thinking of the photo my mother 
sent me. It worries me. She looks older, she’s ageing. I’ve 
never noticed it before. 
‘We’ll go and see some deer if you like,’ I say to Mieko. 
‘Real ones.’ 
‘Where?’ 
‘At  the  zoo.  In  Ueno  Park.  It’s  near  where  my 
grandparents live.’ 
Her face lights up. 
‘Okay.’ 
 
When Madame Ogawa comes home, Mieko chats to her about 
her day. I feel out of place and shut myself in the bathroom. 
Dust has been left to accumulate. No beauty products. Only 
soap, and a shampoo base. I wash my hands. I feel tainted. All 
that rain has stirred up the pollutants, the air is heavy with 
them. Toxins seep into my body through every pore, leak out in 
my sweat. The earth expelling poison through the humans it 
wears on its surface like a coat of hairs. 
 
I go back out and ?nd Madame Ogawa sitting by herself on the 
sofa. She pats the seat beside her, inviting me to join her. She 
asks me how the visit to Disneyland went. I embellish things a 
little, make it sound like Mieko and I get on better than we do. 
‘She’s a lonely child,’ she says eventually. ‘I’m glad she likes 
you.’ 
I smile, out of politeness.

‘What do you think of her French?’ 
‘It’s good.’ 
I ask her why she hasn’t taken on one of her students as a 
tutor for Mieko. 
‘I teach literature, not language,’ she replies. ‘And in any 
case, with my students, it would complicate matters, you 
understand … Having them come here.’ 
‘Of course.’ 
She gives a half-smile. 
‘And besides, it was an opportunity to meet you. I’d like to 
send Mieko to Switzerland later, to a French school.’ 
She tells me she went to university in Switzerland. She 
found the experience profoundly enjoyable. 
‘Have you read Heidi?’ she asks, scanning the bookshelves 
with her eyes. 
I try and remember the story. My mother must have read it 
to me. I have a vague memory of something rather old-
fashioned, about a little girl. 
‘I saw the cartoon long before I realised it was actually a 
book,’  Madame  Ogawa  continues.  ‘I  was  sure  it  was 
Japanese. Johanna Spyri su?ered from depression – but you 
must know this, you live in Switzerland.’ 
I mumble something about not being aware of it. 
She continues, ‘She couldn’t write the book until after she’d 
brought up her children. Do you have children?’ 
‘No,’ I reply hastily. 
She gives me a sidelong glance. 
‘If you do become a mother, I hope for your sake you don’t 
have a daughter. She’ll start comparing herself with you 
eventually. It’s inevitable.’ 
She picks up a folder full of photos, ?ips through them 
and takes one out. 
‘So much open space …’ she says, waving the picture around 
as if it might help her remember something. 
She passes me the photo. I recognise the tram junction, the 
green-tiled steeple. Paradeplatz in Zürich. It makes me think 
of Monopoly, my grandmother trying to ?nd the town where we 
lived on the board.

 My mother and  I  had covered up the last square, Zürich 
Paradeplatz, for fun, and written Yverdon-les-Bains on it in 
indelible felt-tip. Our own Pestalozzi Square, transformed into 
the most expensive real estate in Europe. 
‘You  see,’ I’d explained to my grandmother,  who didn’t 
understand why we were laughing, ‘it’s as if Mum was saying 
that we live in like, I don’t know, Manhattan, or the Champs-
Élysées in Paris.’ 
‘Okay,’ she said, ‘Paris, okay, okay, Paris …’ 
Madame Ogawa pulls out more photos and waves them 
about in the same way before showing them to me. Lausanne 
Cathedral, the Federal Palace, the Bear Pit. 
‘You see,’ she says, ‘I can’t send Mieko over there until she’s 
mastered the language.’ 
‘She can learn it while she’s there …’ 
‘No, that’s out of the question. The standard in Swiss 
schools is very high, she wouldn’t be able to keep up.’ 
Her voice hardens. ‘Perhaps she’d never be able to ?t in. 
Like you, here. You’ll never really be able to speak Japanese, 
will you?’ 
I’m speechless. Every conversation we’ve had has been in 
Japanese. I try to catch her eye but she’s turned away to look 
out the bay window. The city is su?used with  light, Mount Fuji 
drained of colour. The sun’s last rays ?lter through the spaces 
between buildings. 
‘I didn’t know your parents ran a pachinko parlour,’ she says 
eventually. 
‘My grandparents. Why would you know?’ 
‘Couldn’t they ?nd work where they lived?’ 
‘In Korea?’ 
She inclines her head as if to say yes, of course. 
‘Gambling’s  illegal  in  Korea.  They’re  ?ne  here.  They 
have plenty of work.’ 
I choose my words carefully. Gambling for money is illegal 
in Japan too. Pachinko isn’t seen as gambling because the balls 
are exchanged for sweets, toilet paper,  bottles of water, 
toothpaste. Or dominoes. People swap them for money once 
they leave the parlour. Anonymously, through a hole in the wall,

somewhere near the pachinko parlour. 
 
‘They must miss their country.’ 
‘No, they don’t,’ I lie. 
‘And it’s so close. Barely a two-hour ?ight,’ she presses on. 
‘It’s not as simple as that.’ 
Although it is, I think to myself. My grandparents would 
never ?y, but they could go by train, by boat. Tokyo. Nagoya. 
Kyoto. Shin-Osaka. Hiroshima, Hakata. Three hours by ferry to 
Busan, train to Seoul. Simple. 
Madame Ogawa shu?es the photos: 
‘I have nothing against pachinko as such. But children are 
often left in the street while their mothers are playing, and 
when things don’t go so well for the parents, their children 
sometimes have to go without food.’ 
‘It’s not like that at my grandparents’,’ I say, humiliated at 
being forced to defend them. 
‘Of course not.’ 
She goes to say something, hesitates. I’m tempted to say 
more, to invent stories about gangsters, but I can understand 
why she thinks the way she does. I make a point of assuring 
her that I won’t take her daughter there, fully aware that I’ve 
just promised Mieko the opposite. 
Visibly relieved, Madame Ogawa turns to the window. I can 
see from our re?ections that she’s trying not to look at me. She 
gazes o? into the distance, somewhere towards Tokyo Tower, 
the one shaped like the Ei?el Tower. 
‘In the end, it’s no worse than … Nippori’s not such a bad 
place to live. The hillside is stable, safe from earthquakes. 
That’s why they built the cemetery there.’ 
‘Mieko told me about her father.’ 
Silence. 
‘What did she tell you?’ 
‘Not much.’ 
Madame Ogawa smiles sadly. 
‘You know, in Japan, thousands of people disappear every 
year. There are businesses you can go to, to get a new identity.’ 
She turns back to face me.

‘I’m  telling  you  this  to  avoid  misunderstandings.  It  has                                      
nothing to do with Mieko, nor with me. His leaving like that, 
you know, it wasn’t … a betrayal.’ 
I look out of the window. Mount Fuji is shrouded in darkness 
now. The city has become no more than a leaden mass, lifeless. 
Lines are starting to blur inside the apartment too. I feel as 
though I can hardly move. Without the view from the window, 
it would be unbearable.  You’d  su?ocate.  I  have  a  sudden 
image  of 
Mathieu, in his cabin. 
‘It was lovely today,’ I say. ‘We could see Mount Fuji.’ ‘Oh, 
yes?’ 
Madame Ogawa takes a step towards the window. 
‘I hate being up this high. It makes me dizzy. I like it when 
it’s foggy. When you can’t see into the distance. When there’s 
no horizon. It gives me a feeling of having time. That it’s all 
right not to see, not to be aware of what’s in my path.’ 
She gives a short laugh. 
‘When you think about it … about trains … we should really 
build ships and learn to live on the water.’ 
She ?icks the light switch and the furniture takes shape 
again. 
I stand up. 
‘I think I’ll go.’ 
‘You’re not staying? To eat with us, I mean. I bought some 
oysters.’ 
‘My grandparents are expecting me …’ 
She asks me to give her a moment, goes into the kitchen and 
comes back with a jar of greyish liquid for me. 
‘For your grandparents. They’re marinated.’ 
As I stu? the jar into my bag I notice the oysters ?oating in 
the liquid, their frilly edges stained by soy sauce. Madame 
Ogawa presses the button for the lift. I say goodbye, 
addressing her as sensei. She corrects me. I should call her 
Henriette, she says hurriedly, as if to dispel a momentary 
embarrassment. 
‘Henriette,’ I say.

LEANING AGAINST the wall of the carriage, I watch the other 
passengers’ re?ections in the window opposite. A teenager 
hunched over his phone, headphones clamped to his ears. 
Three young women in heels. One of them is putting on her 
make-up, using her friend’s glasses as a mirror. Another pulls 
on a grey tutu over her suit, peeling o? the suit afterwards. 
Some of the men watch. It’s Saturday evening, I’d forgotten. 
Further down, another young woman. Round face, soft arms. 
Her trousers don’t ?t, they’re too long for her. I adjust my 
stance and realise I’ve made myself conspicuous. I straighten 
up, act like I’m playing Tetris to hide my embarrassment. 
I think about what Madame Ogawa – Henriette – said. About 
pachinko and the Shiny.  The sequins. The glitter ball. My 
mother always did her best to keep me away from it during our 
visits. We used to come for two or three weeks a year, it was 
the only time I spent with grandparents. I remember the 
players smelling of grilled meat, cigarettes. How cold it was in 
winter when the doors swung open. The piped music. The 
silent players, deep in concentration, sweating. The machines  
constantly spitting out balls, absorbing the occasional blow. I 
felt almost a?ectionate towards those machines, a kind of pity 
tinged with fear. As soon as they were fed, their contents would 
be regurgitated, undigested. 
My grandfather still had hair then, always carefully combed 
with the same wax that sumo wrestlers use. He let me arrange 
the prizes in the display, making sure my mother didn’t know 
about it. Every evening, he’d go  round checking all the 
machines, taking note of any in need of repair, making sure 
nothing could go wrong. 
There was one incident. A player fed a coin into his 
machine’s rumbling belly.  Nothing happened. No balls 
appeared. He put in another coin. The machine spat it out, 
‘Error’ ?ashed up on the screen. He stared. Thescreen blinked. 
Once. Twice. Went dead. He called for my grandfather, who 
o?ered him another machine to play while he repaired the ?rst 
one.

But the player started shouting about this being his 
machine,  it was the only one he ever played.  He wrapped his  
 
arms round it, as if trying to breathe life into it. My grandfather 
tried to reason with him, but the man still clung to the pachinko 
machine, like a tick to its host. When my grandfather 
threatened to call the police, the man began to cry. I was 
scared and hid by the desk, behind the crates of ?zzy drinks. 
He ended up punching the screen, accusing my grandfather of 
being a crook and screaming that the machine had been 
tampered with. The security guard  was in on it too, he shouted, 
they were dogs, every one of them. He left before he had a 
chance to see the machine spitting out an endless stream of 
balls. They spurted out of every hole, rolling unchecked along 
the ground, rebounding against the other machines, against 
players’ feet, until ?nally they rolled to a stop against the wall. 
My grandfather picked them up one by one and put them 
back into the machine, moving with his customary lack of 
haste. The other players paid no attention. Once he’d ?nished 
he came to ?nd me in my hiding place. Sensing my confusion, 
he looked me in the eyes and said no one was to blame. 
Machines sometimes went wrong. Back then, they were 
manually operated. Now, they’re all computerised. 
I get back to Nippori at seven o’clock in the evening. The sky 
is charcoal grey. Crows circle above the electric wires. Outside 
the Chinese restaurant, people are queuing. 
‘Shiny, Shiny, day and night, shiny, Shiny, shining bright.’ 
I notice the microphone attached to the sandwich- board 
woman’s baseball cap. Her shoes. White trainers, laced up like 
mine, with double bows. She turns her head slightly towards 
me. I pretend to be studying the machines. Yuki is on one near 
the window. I can see the guard behind the counter, facing the 
CCTV monitors, the top of my grandfather’s head as he bends 
to look at something. I’d go in and say hello, see what’s new in 
the displays, the prizes he’s o?ering, but my mind is on that 
conversation with Henriette. I can’t stop thinking about Mieko. 
I go into the Family Mart instead and buy a doughnut.

SHIN-OKUBO, Tokyo’s Koreatown. Life-size cut-outs of pop 
singers and soap stars, shops selling cosmetics. The pavements 
heave with Japanese teenagers. Food trucks stretch for a 
hundred metres, Japanese teens queue for dakkochi. A spicy, 
caramel smell. Shin-Okubo, one long skewer of grilled chicken. 
We’ve walked the entire length of the street without ?nding 
my grandmother’s usual hair salon. Tra?ic sweeps past on the 
main road, the towers of stylish Shinjuku rising on the other 
side. My grandmother wants to cross the road, keep searching. 
I tell her we’ve come  to the end of Koreatown, the salon must 
have closed down, we need to turn back. 
‘You don’t like my hair anyway,’ my grandmother grumbles. 
‘You’re always giving me that funny look.’ 
‘That’s nonsense,’ I say. 
I apologise immediately. I’m overtired. It’s the heat. The 
sandwich-board woman. I can’t stand it, she keeps me awake 
at night. The loudspeaker crackling. My grandmother tugs at 
my sleeve and says something in my ear. I should treat the girl 
nicely. She used to work in a bar as a hostess. Her father came 
in drunk one evening. He made advances to her, not realising 
she was his own daughter. She pushed him away and he broke 
a bottle over her head. 
‘She’s a bit soft in head, you know,’ my grandmother says, 
tapping at her temple. ‘We’ve had her since January.’ 
‘She must get so cold,’ I mutter. ‘Your 
grandfather turns on the heat.’ 
‘Yes, with those enormous boards, I’m sure she’s well 
insulated.’ 
‘Aigou, yeppun sekhi, poor little thing, poor little  thing,’ she 
wails, my sarcastic remark completely lost on her. 
I steer her towards the most brightly coloured boutique, 
regretting it as soon as I see the trendy clients. A woman with 
pink hair ushers her to a seat and asks how she can be of help. 
My grandmother wants a black tint. With a streak of blue. The 
stylist glances at me for approval. 
‘Blue,’ my grandmother says again. 
Whatever I say she’ll be cross. I bury my head in a magazine.

While her hair is being shampooed she starts to talk. The 
stylist nods. My grandmother is getting excited. She’s talking 
about me, boasting of my linguistic prowess, counting o? 
languages on her ?ngers. She says I speak French, German, 
English, Italian. She’s exaggerating, I cringe. She mentions 
Switzerland, ‘seuwisseu, seuwisseu’. The girl pretends to be 
impressed. When my grandmother starts boasting about how 
good my Korean is, I can’t take any more. I stand up. 
‘Are you leaving me?’ she asks, worried. 
I mumble something about coming back soon. 
Outside, I close my eyes, turn my face to the sun. Dots of 
light form beneath my lids. I stand there like that for a moment, 
dazzled. 
 
Not  so  long  ago  my  grandmother  was  still  playing  the 
face game with me. She’d stick plasters all over my face 
and then ask me to say the words: ipp, mouth; noun, eye; 
theok,  chin;  ipsul,  lips;  kho,  nose.  With  each  correct 
answer she would delicately peel o? some of the plasters. 
‘That’s how you discover a face, your little round face, the 
most beautiful face in the world, my granddaughter, my 
little girl, my cupcake, my baby, my big sweetie-pie 
with the little round face.’ 
She’d laugh and stroke my face. But one evening, when I’d 
stumbled over the vocabulary several times, she ripped all the 
plasters o? at once, pulling so roughly I felt my skin burning, 
saying that if I forgot these words, I’d be stuck like that forever, 
with plaster all over my face, like a mummy. 
 
I go to the supermarket and buy ?sh stock, kimchi, the noodles 
she wanted and a tube of sweetened condensed milk. I’ve 
noticed that she likes it, she licks a tube of it before she goes 
to bed, after she’s brushed her teeth. 
 
On my way back to the hairdresser’s I see her on the street. 
She’s looking around frantically, trying to ?nd me. Her hair is 
still damp.

‘Where were you?’ she hisses as I walk up to her. 
‘Didn’t she dry your hair?’ 
‘You walked o?. I walked out too, I didn’t like that girl. 
Where were you?’ 
‘Guess what!’ I say, holding up the bag of shopping. ‘I 
bought you some noodles.’ 
‘I wanted to get them myself. Which ones did you buy?’ 
She starts rummaging in the bag. 
‘Condensed milk! I didn’t know you liked it too! You never 
said!’ 
We  walk back to the station, my grandmother beaming 
happily. She hangs on to my arm. We stumble along, out of step 
with each other, her blue streak ?uttering at my shoulder. 
‘Did you pay the stylist?’ I ask suddenly. 
‘Eh? I’m a thief now, am I?’ 
Inside the station she tells me her train pass has run out of 
credit. The machine is out of order, we need to go to the ticket 
window. She glances up at the station employee, hesitates, 
hands me the card. 
‘You go. I can’t see what I’m doing.’ 
We exchange looks. I know she’s not telling the truth. She 
doesn’t want to go the ticket window because she’ll have to 
speak Japanese. She waits for me in a corner of the concourse, 
staring at her hands. 
 
On the platform I ask her if she and my grandfather have 
thought ahead to when they can’t run the pachinko parlour any 
more. My grandmother brushes away my concern, irritated. 
She’s worked it out. They’d be able to live for four years on 
their savings. And in any case, with her old bones, she won’t 
last long, and have I seen my grandfather, he’ll die before her, 
and if he dies, she will too. I look at her in shock. She laughs, 
says she was joking. I insist. Seriously. They might fall, the 
stairs in their house are steep. Couldn’t they move, delegate 
the management of the Shiny to the security guard perhaps? 
She says my grandfather is ?ne, but the security guard  on the 
other hand is half-dead, plus he wouldn’t be able to a?ord it, 
he’s Japanese.

I’d forgotten. The steep taxes Japanese people have to pay 
when it comes to pachinko. Zainichi Koreans are exempt. 
‘I could always make doughnuts,’ my grandmother declares. 
‘My mother made them in Seoul. That’s what we lived o? 
during the war. I’ll go and sell them in Shin- Okubo.’ 
‘Kkwabaegi? Like the ones you get in the Family Mart? 
I eat those with Mieko.’ 
‘Aigou!’ she spits. ‘Much too sugary, those things, the 
Japanese put sugar in everything!’ 
‘Lotte doughnuts are Korean, aren’t they? Mieko’s crazy 
about them.’ 
‘Who’s she?’ 
‘You know who she is. The little girl.’ My 
grandmother says nothing. 
‘She’d really like to meet you.’ 
Again, silence. 
‘Why?’ 
‘I don’t know. Just because.’ 
I glance over at her. She’s staring at the railway lines. Her 
cheeks are ?ushed. I hear a rumbling sound. The air begins to 
throb. I grab hold of her as a train thunders past. 
It could have been an earthquake. You can’t be sure when 
you hear that sound. I haven’t experienced one yet. Not a real 
one, the kind you feel even in your sleep. I always look around 
for something to anchor myself to when I hear it. I realise it’s 
futile. When a big earthquake strikes, there’s nothing you can 
do. 
‘Eh! Don’t you worry about me,’ my grandmother says. ‘I’ll 
still be making doughnuts when I’m old and doddery!’

IT’S AFTER EIGHT when we arrive back at the house. I’m 
hungry, so is my grandmother. I suggest we make one of her 
favourites, noodles perhaps; I’ll cook. No, she says, we have to 
wait for my grandfather. We could save him some, I suggest. 
She shakes her head, says it’s sad, eating by yourself. We can 
have the noodles another time. We’ll  have leftovers this 
evening, we can reheat the bento boxes. 
She goes out every day to buy them from the stand on the 
corner. The empty boxes end up in a heap behind the kitchen 
door, barely rinsed, still covered in grease. I was horri?ed 
when I ?rst saw them. I thought back to the hours we used to 
spend together cooking, making pancakes, soups and stews: 
eomuk and soegogi-jin,  kimchi and miyeok-guk; and sweet 
dishes like honey ice cream and hotteok. We’d spend whole 
afternoons in the kitchen, my grandmother as chef and me as 
her assistant, her apron knotted around my waist. I was 
responsible for cleaning up; my grandmother insisted on 
everything being kept spotless. We bumped into each other 
constantly in that tiny kitchen. What happened? When did she 
start buying takeaways? 
I’d asked her a while back if she was all right. I was worried 
about her alone in the house all day. I thought she might be 
bored. ‘I’m ?ne, I’m ?ne,’ she said, gently stroking my back. ‘I 
take naps.’ 
And when I asked if she had anything to read, she ?red 
back scathingly, read what? I let it go. 
She probably didn’t like me drawing attention to the fact 
that she didn’t read. I knew she’d held ambitions to study when 
she was young, Mathieu had told me. She wanted to become a 
lawyer. But then the Korean War came and they ?ed to Japan. 
And besides, she was a girl, her parents wouldn’t have allowed 
her to go to university. 
Trying not to think about how hungry I am, I put the water on 
to boil and make a jug of black tea. I add some ice cubes to cool 
it down, stir in some condensed milk. My grandmother turns 
on the television in the living room.  I ask if she wants  to  play  
Monopoly. She’s thrilled.

We set it up on the low table. My grandmother chooses the 
wheelbarrow, I take the thimble. It’s been twenty years since 
we last played. I read through the instructions to remind 
myself of the rules. My grandmother immediately starts 
installing hotels wherever she lands, whether she owns the 
property or not. She doesn’t like the houses, she says, they’re 
too small. 
‘That’s one of mine,’ I say. 
She rolls the dice, dislodging the buildings. 
‘You see,’ I say, ‘they’re righting themselves of their own 
accord.’ 
No response. She’s too engrossed in the game. She throws 
a double, moves her wheelbarrow to the ‘just visiting’ square, 
throws again. Another double. This time she lands on 
Lausanne, Rue du Bourg. She buys it. Throws again for the 
third time. 
‘Double sixes!’ she cries. ‘You see! It’s my lucky day!’ ‘Well, 
no, actually,’ I say, after a quick glance at the 
rules. ‘On the third double you have to go to jail.’ 
‘Why? I haven’t done anything wrong!’ 
‘That’s the game. The rules. It’s all the luck of the dice.’ 
‘You’re just jealous,’ she complains. ‘You’re cheating.’ 
I can’t show her the proof, the rules are written in French, 
German and English, languages she doesn’t understand. She 
has a choice between paying to get out or waiting for three 
goes. 
‘That’s no fun,’ she says. 
I let her have her way. It would make more sense to play 
with three people. With my mother. My grandmother says she 
wants to start the game again. I go to prison in her place. 
Better to let her play on and keep the game going. I swap our 
pieces round. 
The ice cubes have melted in the jug. Water ?oats above the 
milk. I stir it with my spoon. The tea turns cloudy, opaque. I 
take a sip. It tastes like Mieko’s royal milk tea, a little less 
sweet, perhaps. 
When I look up, my grandmother is staring at me. ‘Is 
it my turn?’ I ask. 
She asks me how I am.

‘I’m ?ne, how are you?’ I reply, disconcerted. I say it without 
thinking. As I would to someone I don’t know. It’s unsettling. 
‘I’m ?ne. What about you?’ I say again, more slowly. ‘You’re 
tired,’  she  says.  ‘You said  so  earlier, in  Shin- 
Okubo. You work too hard.’ 
‘No, I don’t, most of the time I do nothing.’ 
It’s true. Apart from when I’m with Mieko, I spend my days 
in my room, on the tatami mat, looking up Korea on the 
internet or playing inane games on my phone. Two weeks have 
gone by already. And the trip still isn’t organised. I’m suddenly 
seized with panic. 
My grandmother has taken the other Monopoly pieces out 
of the box. The shoe, the iron, the horse and the car. She lines 
them up along the board. 
‘You’re not enjoying this,’ she says. 
‘Yes, I am.’ 
‘No need to force yourself. You go o? and play. I’m ?ne 
here, in the living room.’ 
She nods towards the stairs. 
‘Okay, okay, go, go.’ 
‘But I’m perfectly happy here with you!’ 
She looks up, ‘Really?’ 
‘Really. Come on. Let’s get on with the game.’ 
I throw the dice, move my piece forward, ignoring the 
number displayed on the dice. We stare at the board, rolling 
the dice in turn, lost in our world of Monopoly,  until my 
grandfather comes home and we clear it all  away to set the 
table for dinner.

LATER  IN THE EVENING, I go online, do some searching. 
September is the best time of year to visit Korea. Ferries go 
from Fukuoka in southern Japan to Busan. Night crossings are 
less expensive but they’re slow. There are faster ones that only 
take three hours. We’ll book one of those. And then what? 
Should we stop in Busan for the night to break the journey? Or 
would it be better to do it all in one day? My grandparents will 
be tired, but I want to make the most of the time we have there. 
I google ‘port of Busan’ and images of bridges pop up. It seems 
there are several in the bay. The largest is shown from various 
angles. Ships sail beneath it. An enormous bridge. The ?rst 
thing you see when you arrive from Japan by sea. It’s visible 
from a long way o?, lit up at night like a bow and arrow aimed 
at the moon. 
 
Mathieu sends me his news. He’s making progress but he has 
a large group of hikers there, he’s very busy. There was a 
storm last night, with high winds. A couple has arrived with a 
nine-month-old baby. Seriously. A baby! I type a quick answer, 
not mentioning the baby or Mieko. 
 
There’s a message from my mother about my father’s latest 
concert. I still haven’t responded to the recording she sent me 
?ve days ago. She’s probably worried about me but she’s afraid 
to say it. She asks what my grandparents say about her. 
 
Nothing. They don’t talk about you. 
I read over what I’ve written. Erase it. 
Everything’s ?ne. They send their love. 
I close my laptop and roll over onto the ?oor. Cars throw 
spray onto the pavement. A child jumps in puddles, his mother 
pulling him along by the hand, he looks like he’s ?ying. 
It’s almost twenty years since we last went anywhere together.

My mother, my grandmother and me. In the Museum of Nature 
and Science in Ueno, the hall devoted to evolution. Images 
projected onto a circular screen, silhouette ?gures ?ling past, 
men, women and children. On horseback, then in carriages, in 
cars and ?nally in a spaceship. They hold hands as they move 
on, leaping forwards to each new era. The soundtrack reminds 
me of a song, from the ?lm Noddy in Toyland – four beats to a 
bar, jaunty. My mother whispers something to my grandmother, 
they’re arguing in Korean, I don’t know what about, I hear my 
mother say the word ‘slave’ again and again. I wait. I watch the 
?lm several times. I want to move on to another room. The next 
one is full of animals. I ask my mother if I can go and look. She 
says no, it’s time to go home. My grandmother says  pointedly 
that just for once she could let me do as I like, I only want to 
see a few animals. My mother looks daggers at her. 
‘Oh, all right,’ she says, giving me a push, ‘go on then, 
go on!’ 
And I go running in to see the exhibition of stu?ed animals. 
My footsteps ring out beneath the vaulted stone ceiling. Bears, 
tigers, deer, pandas, aboard Noah’s ark. Clumps of dried fur 
fallen on the ground. It’s late afternoon. The sky clouds over, 
daylight fades, the lights come on. I stand in front of the lion 
and stare into its gaping jaws. The tongue coated in dust. 
Unseeing eyes. 
On the walls, huge panels displaying insects, pinned through 
the belly or the back, legs splayed. I turn round and realise I’m 
all alone, my mother and grandmother are still in the other 
room. I run back, bury my face in my mother’s skirt, 
smothering my tears. 
‘What else did you expect?’ she says, speaking in French. 
‘They’re nothing but stu?ed animals.’ She turns to face my 
grandmother and adds: ‘Old carcasses, with glass beads for 
eyes.’ 
 
Back at the house, my grandmother asked me what my mother 
had said. 
‘Nothing,’ I lied.

I told them I’d been scared in the museum, imagining the 
lions would be real. My mother said we could put on a video of 
The Lion King to make me feel better. My grandmother o?ered 
to keep me company – she’d never seen a Disney ?lm before. 
We watched the whole ?lm together, from start to ?nish. 
That was how we started watching cartoons together. After 
that she’d sometimes put on a video while she was cooking or 
cleaning. She seemed to understand, even though it was all in 
French. It was the music she liked, its ubiquitous presence. 
 
My mother cut short our stay that year. My grandfather took 
us to the airport; my grandmother didn’t come, the planes 
scared her, she said. After that, my mother’s visits became 
more and more scarce; for two years, she sent me to Tokyo by 
myself for the holidays, and then I started at the lycée and my 
summers were taken up with activities. When I eventually went 
back years later, it was Mathieu who came with me.

I WAKE UP at one in the morning to sounds coming from  the 
bathroom. Running water, soft chuckles. I knock on the door. 
No answer, I go in. My grandmother is leaning over the basin, 
her shoulders soaked. She wanted to see if the colour would 
hold, she says. It’s all washed away. She titters, and gestures 
to me to be quiet, my grandfather is asleep upstairs. I help her 
change her blouse. She carries on chuckling to herself. I dry 
her hair. She’s cold. I rub her skin, soft and papery, dotted with 
bruises. She’s stopped laughing. She stares at her face in the 
mirror. 
‘Doddery old fool,’ she says.

BY THE TIME we ?nish our lesson, it’s already getting dark. 
Henriette has asked me to stay on past the usual time, she has 
a meeting. Mieko declares that she has something to show me. 
She wants to take me up to the roof. 
We  climb the emergency staircase and step out onto a 
platform. Air vents cling to its surface like leeches. Smoke 
billows up from below. Looking down, all you can see are low-
rise buildings, no higher than the lamp-posts, lights coming on 
in the windows. Signposts. No cars. Everything seems to ?oat, 
like jelly?sh in the sky. Mieko points at the building across the 
way. 
‘That’s where the bee came from. They’re Tokyo bees. They 
make cherry blossom honey because cherry blossoms are the 
only ?owers in the city.’ 
It takes me a while to make out the hives. Little houses lined 
up by the dozen on the roof. 
‘I’m cold, I’m going to get something warm,’ Mieko says, 
heading back inside. 
I walk over to the edge. Cawing of crows. Ambulance sirens. 
Mu?ed sounds. A spider spins its web on the railing; it looks 
as big as the rooftop baseball pitches in the distance, their 
safety nets. 
A player, his hand frozen in mid-air, waiting to catch a ball. 
He hurls his body forward in slow motion, surely it will take 
him years to return to his original position. I stand watching 
this lone player for a moment, mirroring his gestures, their 
in?nite slowness, wondering if he really is playing or if it’s a 
trick of perception, if time has stalled and slowed down all 
movement. 
‘Onni?’ 
Mieko is staring at me, holding a thermos and two towels. I 
become conscious of the way I’m standing: on one foot, one leg 
raised with bent knee, one hand in the air. I adjust my stance, 
show too much enthusiasm for the thermos, say it’s a sure sign 
that summer is ending. 
‘It’s cold,’ she laughs. ‘It’s royal milk tea.’

We wrap ourselves in the towels. They’re too short for me, 
they stop just below my stomach. 
‘The bees are dying,’ says Mieko. ‘So are the trees. There 
aren’t nearly as many as there used to be in the city. One day 
they’ll all be dead, and then we’ll all die too.’ 
I turn to look at her. 
‘I’m scared too, you know.’ 
‘Of the bees?’ 
‘Of the trees dying. Everything. That’s why I like going up 
high in the mountains, at least it’s normal for there to be no 
trees there.’ 
‘I’ve never seen anything like that,’ says Mieko. 
‘Maybe you will some day.’ 
We huddle together, drink the tea straight from the 
thermos, passing it back and forth between us. The crescent 
moon has come into view, lying on its side. It always surprises 
me in Japan, the way the moon seems to be sleeping, while in 
Switzerland it stands upright. I tell Mieko. She cranes her neck 
to look at the moon from a di?erent angle. 
‘Are you looking forward to going away?’ I ask. 
‘Mum says it’s for my future.’ 
‘What about you? What do you think?’ 
‘I don’t know really. It’s ages away. When are we going to 
the pachinko parlour?’ 
‘I’m not sure there’ll be enough time,’ I mumble. 
‘Later – when the holidays are over!’ 
I say we’ll have to see. Her chin puckers. I’m afraid she 
might start to cry, so I say light-heartedly: 
‘When I was little, I wanted to be a chlorophyll  splitter.’ 
She looks at me quizzically. I explain to her what chlorophyll 
is, that it helps plants to breathe, like our blood helps us. Blood 
and chlorophyll are actually very similar, four atoms grouped 
around a central atom. The only di?erence is that chlorophyll 
has magnesium where haemoglobin has iron. 
‘I used to think that if humans could work out how to break 
chlorophyll down, extract the magnesium and insert it into our 
bloodstream, we’d be able to produce our own oxygen simply 
by exposing ourselves to light.

I decided it could be a job, being a chlorophyll splitter. That’s 
what I wanted to do when I grew up.’ 
‘Why didn’t you?’ 
‘I started thinking about splitting atoms and about that 
being a way of making atomic bombs.’ 
Mieko is quiet for a few minutes, thinking. 
‘How old are you, actually?’ 
‘Thirty. Well, almost.’ 
‘Thirty! I’m ten.’ 
‘I  know,’  I  say, irritated. 
‘When’s your birthday?’ 
‘Soon.’ 
‘Soon when?’ 
‘20th of August.’ 
She counts on her ?ngers, overjoyed suddenly, I’ve no idea 
why. 
The baseball player has gone. The deserted pitch is bathed 
in radiance beneath the lights. Arti?cial daylight. The wind 
picks up. Tokyo’s stations come into view, criss- crossed with 
lines, some overhead, some at ground level, trains running 
along them. 
‘The trains look like ?sh, don’t they?’ Mieko says. 
‘Sort of. Some of them.’ 
‘Did you know that a long, long time ago, oceans covered 
the whole of the planet? Fish could swim anywhere, even above 
this building. That’s why my fatherwanted his trains to look 
like ?sh. Or dragons. Dragons evolved from ?sh.’ 
She laughs. ‘And there are slug trains too – trams, and the 
metro, underground worms. But they’re not my dad’s trains.’ 
The Shinkansen is the fastest train in the world, I say, she 
can be proud of her father for making it possible for so many 
people to travel so far so fast. She hates her father, she says, 
he only worked on building those trains so he could run away 
from her and her mother. She stands, folds up our towels, her 
movements uncharacteristically harsh. 
‘I’m hungry,’ she declares. ‘Let’s go back down.

She wants an omelette. The fridge is full of eggs, her mother 
has stocked up: quails’ eggs, hens’ eggs, scrambled eggs, 
square omelettes from Family Mart, egg salads. There’s even 
a vacuum-packed fried egg, its yolk bulbous beneath the 
transparent packaging. I take out one of the omelettes. Mieko 
shakes her head, she wants to make it from scratch. 
‘Are you sure?’ 
Making an omelette  wasn’t included in Henriette’s 
instructions, I say. 
‘Yes, it was,’ she says, cracking an egg on the side of the 
pan. 
I watch nervously. Egg white runs down along the shell and 
over her ?ngers, like drool from a sleeper’s lips. I haven’t 
handled raw eggs since I came upon one with an embryo. I 
?ddle with the ready-made omelette, feeling its texture 
through the packaging. Like a sponge. I give it a squeeze and 
something yellowish oozes from it. I let go and it’s sucked back 
in. Mieko lights the burner, she’s beaten at least ten eggs. 
Mum says I have to eat food from abroad so I can get used 
to it before I leave. Apparently I’ll be ready to go when all my 
cells have regenerated with new kinds of food.’ 
I ask her if she knows why her mother wants me to call her 
Henriette, I’m sure it’s not her real name. She shrugs. 
‘Probably because of Heidi.’ 
‘Heidi?’ 
‘It starts with the same letter.’ 
The eggs start to sputter in the pan, exploding limply, 
shooting specks of yellow in every direction. 
Mieko presses her ?nger to one, puts it in her mouth: 
‘Mmmm, that’s good, nice and crisp.’ 
After we’ve eaten, she asks me to help her in the shower. She 
undresses, throws her clothes in a ball into the basin. The 
bathroom is too small for two people. I sit on the toilet and 
stare discreetly at the ?oor. I haven’t seen a female child’s body 
since I grew up myself. The heat is intense, but Mieko still 
turns the hot water on full. Steam envelops us. I look over at 
her.

She’s rubbing herself with a facecloth. Smooth skin, arms so 
skinny you want to grip them ?rmly to stop them falling o?. 
Angular shoulder blades, pointed, like ?ns. The soap refuses to 
lather. I think of Henriette’s dry skin, tell myself they need 
something more moisturising, less harsh. When she closes her 
eyes to wash her face, I take a good look at her. She hasn’t 
started to develop yet. Just two nipples, scarcely de?ned, two 
drops of water on paper. Maybe she won’t need to wear a bra, 
any more than her mother does. 
I was only a year older than she is now when my breasts 
began to develop. When my grandmother noticed, she pressed 
her thumbs against my chest, as if to push the swelling back 
inside me, as if it didn’t belong there. My mother had bought 
me a bra just before the holidays. It was too tight, it cut into 
my ?esh, I was ashamed of it. I’d hide in the toilets, rubbing 
my breasts, fretting about the lack of a lock on the door, 
terri?ed my grandmother would walk in without knocking. 
The humidity in the bathroom is becoming unbearable. My 
hair is glued to my temples. I brush it aside, ?ap my skirt 
around my thighs. Mieko is still soaping herself. I go and wait 
in the living room. 
I browse the bookshelves. My eye falls on a French translation 
of Heidi, between two classic Pléiade volumes. The pages are 
dotted with notes in Japanese, in green pen, like blades of 
grass left to dry between the pages. It’s hard to read the text 
beneath the green. Lines stand out. 
The eagle looks down on the villagers from the sky: 
‘If you would separate and each go your own way and come 
up here and live on a height as I do, it would be better for you!’ 
Or the goatherd’s grandmother talking to Heidi: ‘The house 
is going to pieces, and in the night, when the two others are 
asleep, I often lie awake in fear and trembling, thinking that 
the whole place will give way and fall and kill us. And there is 
not a creature to mend anything for us, for Peter does not 
understand such work.’ 
Feeling uncomfortable, I put the book back on the shelf.  A 
lea?et falls out from the back cover. Heidi’s Village. I open it 
out.

A theme park, based on the Ghibli studios’ animated version. 
Located in the prefecture of Yamanashi, near the Hokuto hills, 
two hours from Tokyo. I place the lea?et on the co?ee table, 
linger  over  the  shelf of children’s picture books. Geometric 
shapes, bright coloured squares and rectangles. Titles I don’t 
recognise, except for Ernest & Célestine. I’m sure I’ve read this 
one too, I think, as I open the book. 
Watercolours.  Beige wash. Ernest seems smaller than I 
remember him being. And little Célestine seems much bigger. 
They’re in the forest, putting up a tent, a homeless person 
comes to live in it. I’m startled to see how few words there are 
to a page. It seemed so long when my mother read it to me, 
there were so many words: Célestine going to school, reading 
books, stories within stories, Ernest falling in love with a polar 
bear he meets in the frozen north. There’s nothing of that here, 
either in the words or the pictures. Did my mother make it all 
up? I remember asking her to speak slowly, making sure what 
she said matched the words on the page. But I hadn’t learnt to 
read then, and when I did start reading by myself I’d lost 
interest in Ernest and Célestine. 
 
The end, already. The homeless person moves out,  leaving 
presents for his mystery hosts. I close the book. 
A bear and a baby mouse. An odd pairing for a story. 
Célestine must have been an orphan, I suppose, her mother 
eaten by a cat. Now that I think about it, Ernest’s broad, 
vaulted back speaks of a burden of su?ering from long ago, 
from the time when he comforted Célestine, took her in. I’d 
never thought of it like that before. 
 
Hearing the slip-slap of wet feet, I look up. Wrapped in her 
mother’s robe, Mieko sits down beside me. She points at the 
Heidi’s Village lea?et. 
‘I went there on a school trip. It’s rubbish.’ ‘I wouldn’t mind 
going there.’ 
‘I’m  warning  you,  it’s  for  little  kids.’

She takes a deep breath, exhales jerkily. 
‘Do you have trouble breathing? I often see you doing 
that with your mouth.’ 
She shakes her head, says she’s ?ne. Then, nodding 
towards Ernest & Célestine, ‘Will you read it to  me?’ 
I start at the beginning, but she ?ips to a page near the 
middle. ‘I like this bit best.’ 
We turn o? the lights, except for one on the wall next to the 
sofa. As I read, Mieko slumps against me, I can feel her getting 
heavier. She falls asleep, her head in my lap. Henriette comes 
home and ?nds us in the same position. I haven’t moved, not 
wanting to wake Mieko. When I get up to leave, she waves her 
hand, like Célestine in the beam of a torch, waving to Ernest 
from the tent.

THE NEXT DAY Henriette messages me. Mieko wants me to 
take her to Heidi’s Village. She suggests we go on the 20th. We 
could celebrate my birthday at their place when we get back. 
They’ll be away until then, spending a week at a seaside resort 
in Okinawa. The tone of her message is cool. I feel somewhat 
wounded that neither of them has  mentioned this beach 
holiday to me. I didn’t say anything to Henriette about it being 
my  birthday.  Mieko must have  told  her.  I wasn’t planning 
anything special for the day,  I haven’t even talked to my 
grandparents about it. As far as they’re concerned, I’ve already 
turned thirty: in the Korean system, a person’s age is counted 
from the moment of conception. I reread the message, say yes 
to the invitation. 
 
With Mieko away, I feel at a loss. I spend too much time in my 
bedroom, crushed by the heat. I’d like to go out to  a museum, 
leave the neighbourhood, but my  grandmother worries so 
much when I go out. I hear her humming a lullaby in Korean, 
always the same one. It’s nothing like the ones she used to sing 
to me when I was little, I don’t recognise it. Sometimes I go 
and wander in the cemetery, listen to the cicadas shrieking. I 
walk along the quiet street that runs behind the station, sit on 
the stairs sipping ice-cold amazake, surrounded by cats. This 
must be the meeting-ground for all the cats in the 
neighbourhood. 
 
We’re supposed to be leaving in two weeks and my grandfather 
still hasn’t con?rmed the dates for our trip. I don’t dare ask 
him again. There’s so much to organise. I start by searching 
online to get as much information as I can about the trains. 
We’d need to take the Shinkansen and go up the east side via 
Kyoto and Hiroshima. Five hours in all, a long journey for two 
elderly people. We could stop over at the island of Miyajima, 
where Mieko went with her father. It’s only a few kilometres 
from Hiroshima.

I mention it to my grandparents.  It’s  up  to  me,  they  say,  
 
they’re happy to go along with whatever I decide. They’re not 
really listening, they’re too busy staring at the television. 
 
Once in a while, I play Monopoly with my grandmother. We’re 
just starting our game one day when she nods towards my 
bedroom and says, out of the blue: ‘Okay, okay, go, go.’ 
I feign protest, carry on playing. After a while, I stand up 
and go downstairs, feeling sad but relieved. 
 
I can hear them talking upstairs; snippets of conversation ?oat 
down to me through the ceiling. My grandfather, holding forth 
about the Shiny. More and more women are playing these days 
but they don’t really feel welcome. They’re mostly non-
smokers. Some parlours have separate sections for smokers 
nowadays. Some of them target women players, provide 
childcare. Perhaps it was time to make some changes at the 
Shiny. 
 
I tense up when I hear this. They never mention Korea. I write 
to Mathieu: the time for our trip is fast approaching, I feel as 
if I’m dragging them there. Nothing seems to be happening 
here. I’m starting to think we’ll never get there. He tells me to 
see it from their perspective, they must be feeling anxious, 
everything will have changed, it’s been such a long time since 
they  left  their  home.  Do  I  need  any  help?  He  can buy the 
tickets, do some of the translating for me. No, it’s all ?ne, I 
reply,  feeling somewhat piqued. I can take care of it. 
Everything is ?ne. On his side, the thesis is coming together. 
He can see the end in sight. He wishes me a happy birthday, he 
won’t be able to write to me on the day but he’ll make it up to 
me when I get back, promise. 
 
I have a craving for marzipan. Fatty, comforting. My mother 
used to give it to me to drink, watered down. She fed it to me

in a bottle, even though I was much too big by then for a bottle. 
I’ve broken my record at Tetris. I’ve been stuck on level 
?fteen for days. 
 
The days are beginning to draw in. The sky is dark by seven in 
the evening. I lie on the ?oor and gaze out of the window. 
Women’s  calves, men’s shoes, heels trodden down by the 
weight of bodies borne for too long. Salarymen, I can tell from 
the rigid gait, the uniform. Footsteps of people in a hurry, 
people dragging their feet. I turn away, try to block them out, 
but then I see their shadows ?le past on my bedroom wall, 
distorted, magni?ed in the beam of the streetlight. Sometimes 
a taxi parks in front of the window, the driver asleep, forehead 
resting on the steering wheel. 
 
I go to the Family Mart to buy some shampoo, select one with 
almond milk, my favourite, highly moisturising. At the edge of 
my vision, I catch a glimpse of my grandfather through the 
door at the back, inside the Shiny. He walks slowly down the 
aisle, stopping in front  of every machine to give it a slap on 
the side, as if he were urging on a beast of burden at the end 
of a long day’s labour. He goes back to the desk, takes his seat 
beside the security guard. A player comes up and hands in his 
collection of balls, walks out holding a stu?ed bear. 
 
I step out of the shop into a downpour. Warm rain falling in a 
steady stream, washing away the ?lm of grease from every 
surface. A summer storm, short-lived. I decide to wait it out. 
I walk up to the sandwich-board woman, stand behind her 
under the awning. She has a patch of bare skin where her hair 
is swept to one side in a plait. Water splashes from the canopy. 
Drops land on the back of her neck. She doesn’t ?inch. The 
rigid cardboard panels hang down to her ankles, slapping 
against her body, bu?eted by the wind. I take another step 
towards her, she smells of rain and laundry soap. I can’t see her 
face. Her eyelids are cast down beneath the peaked cap, her 
shoulders hunched. Passers-by take no notice of us. They walk  
on.

Some stop in the doorway of the Shiny. I adjust my position, try 
to see their faces – I only ever see their legs from my bedroom 
window. Their heads are turned away, their collars turned up, 
hands deep in their pockets. I step out onto the pavement, in 
front of the sandwich- board woman. In an instant, I’m soaked 
through. My clothes feel heavy, like a suit of armour. People 
step carefully around me, avoiding all contact. Behind me, the 
sandwich-board girl goes on chanting her ditty into the 
microphone. I have an urge to walk right up to her, rip away 
the boards and shout in her face: look at me.

THE  HEATWAVE  INTENSIFIES.  On the morning of my 
birthday, the weather presenter issues a warning, urging the 
populace, especially the elderly, to avoid going out, to stay 
inside in the cool and drink plenty of ?uids. 
‘Did you hear that?’ I call out to my grandmother as I tie my 
shoelaces. 
I’ve prepared bottles of water for her to drink during the 
day. I can hear her moving about upstairs. She seems strangely 
agitated. I sensed it last night. She keeps going in and out of 
the kitchen, walking  round in circles. Since breakfast this 
morning, I’ve had the feeling she’s waiting for me to leave. 
‘Okay, okay, go, go!’ she shouts back at me from the living 
room. 
 
I meet Mieko in Shinagawa. We take the Yamanote line to 
Shinjuku together, where the trains for the Yamanashi 
Prefecture leave from. 
‘How was it with your mum? Everything all right?’ 
She nods, staring out of the window. She’s hardly said a 
word all morning. When I ?nally ask her why she’s so quiet she 
says it’s because the holidays are almost over. 
 
We  leave behind the outskirts of Tokyo,  emerging  into 
countryside. Mossy forests. Small valleys. One hour later, at 
the end of the Chuo line, we take a bus, together with a handful 
of old men, all wearing bandanas. The bus jolts along a gravel 
road for about ten kilometres, dropping us beside a high wall 
that marks the perimeter of Heidi’s Village. 
 
For some reason, entry into the park is free of charge today. 
There’s no one at the reception desk. On the other side of the 
wall, we emerge onto a square surrounded by medieval 
façades that are vaguely Alsatian in style. A church, a town 
hall, a restaurant, a museum dedicated to the animated ?lm of 
Heidi,  and  a  tower  boasting  a  panoramic  view.

     <text><![CDATA[ 
A  sign  in gothic-style lettering on the façade of the town hall: 
‘Zürich’. Except for the old people, who’ve disappeared up the 
stairs between the tower and the church, Mieko and I are the 
only ones  here. We climb the stairs. They lead to a miniature 
train station, the platform lined with a single long bench. The 
rails disappear into an area of dense greenery, criss- crossed 
with walkways. The bell tower strikes eleven. There’s a smell 
of cut grass. 
‘Can’t we walk?’ I ask Mieko, who’s already sitting down. 
‘No.  But there’s the train. It’s coming now,’ she says, 
pointing towards the far side of the park. 
Shielding my eyes with my hand I can just make out a red 
train carriage winding its way through a ?eld of sun?owers. 
Around it, old men are at work, harvesting, watering, clearing 
the ground. 
Piped music ?lls the  air.  Familiar-sounding. ‘Edelweiss’ 
from  The Sound of Music. Mieko cranes forward, gazing 
intently at the pond on the other side of the track. 
‘Look at that grey ?sh, the one with white spots. It’s a 
cleaner ?sh. Did you know they keep on getting bigger, for the 
whole of their lives?’ 
‘I know. I had one in my ?sh tank when I was little.’ 
‘They can’t grow up properly when they’re in an 
aquarium. They don’t live as long, they die when they’re still 
no bigger than babies.’ 
I tip my chin in acknowledgement. That wasn’t the reason 
my ?sh died. I was thirteen, just starting at middle school. For 
some reason I’d become obsessed with having an aquarium. 
My parents were sceptical at ?rst but in the end,  they  bought 
me  a  thirty-litre  tank,  with  a  pair  of guppies, four neon 
tetras and a pleco. The salesperson said the pleco would clean 
up all the algae and other impurities in the tank. It didn’t quite 
work out that way. The algae spread all over the tank and 
before long it obscured everything. I despaired as I watched 
the ?sh die one by one, all except the pleco. I thought it was 
probably very happy to have so much food all to itself. But the 
pleco died too and after that we grew cacti. I found out later 
that I’d been misinformed. Plecos need more than algae in their 
diet.

I should have given it special food, just like the other ?sh, 
with specially adapted nutrients. 
 
The train pulls in, two old men get o?, we climb in. We’re o?, 
the pace so slow it’d be quicker to walk. The driver, in his 
peaked cap, stares straight ahead. We’ve barely travelled a 
hundred metres when he applies the brakes and calls out: 
‘Fifteen-minute halt.’ 
The attraction we’re visiting is a log cabin, Heidi’s 
grandfather’s. A chain slung across the open door bars visitors 
from entering. We stand in front of the display, a single room 
with a wooden table on which pieces of arti?cial food are 
arranged, with labels written in Japanese: ‘cheese’, ‘meat’, 
‘bread’. A ladder leads up to the loft where Heidi sleeps. 
Mieko examines the exhibits carefully, putting on a show of 
attention for her guest who is seeing it for the ?rst time. I look 
around the cabin. Cut-out rabbits stand on the bare earth at 
the back, holding up a placard, warped by sunlight. ‘Sorry, we 
are absent due to maintenance’ it reads, in English. I feel a 
migraine coming on. I’m only too glad to get back on the train 
and ?nd some shade even though the heat is even more intense 
under the metal roof of the carriage. 
Meanwhile, the village square has come to life. In the 
restaurant, women fuss over a fondue pot, their movements 
visible through the orange-tinted steam. Mieko and I sit down 
on the steps of the church. With a bloom of sweat on her she 
looks like a doll, brand new, still wrapped in plastic. She turns 
to face me, asks for my permission to go back to the garden. 
‘Yes, you can go.’ 
She walks with heavy steps towards the stairs. I lean back 
against the wall of the church and feel it shudder. I peer 
through a stained-glass window and realise it’s only a façade, 
made of plaster, supported by a metal frame. 
I do a tour of the shop. On o?er are ?gurines,  cows  made  of  
wood with red or black spots. They remind me of my ?rst school 
trip, to a farm in Appenzell.

I must have been seven or eight at the time. The farmer’s wife 
made little cows just like these. At the end of the visit we were 
all given some strong-smelling cheese. Most of my classmates 
threw it away, especially the girls, who put on extravagant 
displays of disgust for the bene?t of  the boys. I hid mine in my 
bag. I wanted to take it home for my mother. In the bus, the 
smell started to waft out. Everyone turned in my direction and 
someone said I stank and told me to go and sit somewhere else. 
I moved to the back of the bus, hugging my bag close in an 
e?ort to contain the smell. By the time I reached home, fat had 
seeped out onto my homework notebook. It smelt of cheese for 
the rest of the year. But my gift was a success. My mother loved 
it. 
 
It seems a long time since Mieko went o? by herself. I walk 
back through the park and catch sight of her squatting on her 
heels beside the pond. The horizon shimmers in the heat. I 
don’t want to disturb her. I wander among the ?ower beds, 
keep walking to where the vegetation is denser, not so well 
maintained, until I come to a greenhouse, as big as the 
grandfather’s chalet, in the shadow of a windmill. On the metal 
door is an inscription in Japanese lettering, the characters 
interwoven with kittens: ‘Clara’s Sanatorium’. I go inside, 
amused. 
 
The air feels cooler in the greenhouse. Gardening tools, a 
collection of miniature olive trees growing in containers. Water 
burbles from an imitation marble fountain. I taste olive oil on 
my tongue, full and round, the taste of summer holidays. A 
plastic duck paddles on the spot, its beak caught in the spigot. 
A caterpillar crawls along the edge. Feeling suddenly dizzy, I 
lean against the fountain, almost crushing the caterpillar. 
‘Are you all right?’ 
A woman is watching me from the back of the greenhouse, 
a tray of olives in one hand, a pair of secateurs in the other. 
Immaculate uniform, in the park’s colours: red and white, a 
curious hybrid of the Swiss and Japanese ?ags.

She brings me a glass of water from the drinking fountain. 
‘You need ?uids in this heat. You’ll get heatstroke. Are 
you from here?’ she asks as she wipes her hands. 
I tell her I’m Korean. 
‘Oh,’ she says, smiling. ‘You speak very good Japanese.’ 
Her teeth look discoloured, like shrivelled olives, her mouth 
must be dry. 
‘What I meant was, are you new here? Are you on the 
sta??’ 
‘No, I live in Switzerland.’ 
She blinks. 
‘Oh well, in that case,’ she says, smiling again, relaxed, ‘I’m 
so sorry, but you can’t stay here. It says so there, on the door.’ 
‘I’m sorry, I didn’t see.’ 
As I’m leaving, she adds, with concern in her voice, ‘You 
really don’t look too well. You should go home.’ 
 
Mieko is sitting in front of the church, waiting for me. In her 
lap, an empty sandwich wrapper and an unopened can of 
Pocari Sweat. She hands it to me and I open it and take a swig. 
Warm, slightly salty. I set it down between us. 
Mieko points to it timidly, ‘Dare I?’ she asks me in French. 
I hand it to her immediately, ashamed not to have realised 
that she was waiting for me to drink ?rst. I hadn’t stopped to 
think about whether she was hungry or thirsty. I ought to 
explain to her that she’s used the wrong verb to ask me. It’s 
too late now.  Secretly,  I ?nd it reassuring that she makes 
mistakes. It reminds me that she is only a child. 
 
In the bus on the way back, Mieko holds my hand. Suddenly, 
she pulls away from me and sticks her mouth against the 
window, making loud sucking sounds. 
‘Hey! What are you doing?’ 
She pulls her lips away for a moment. 
‘Cleaner ?sh.’ 
She takes a deep breath, ready to start again. I put my hand 
on her shoulder to restrain her.

‘Don’t do that! It’s ?lthy!’ 
She slumps back in her seat, obediently. Her lips have left a 
mark on the window, a circle of saliva, chilled by  the air 
conditioning. I close my eyes to avoid catching  the  other 
passengers’ gaze. A few minutes later I feel the weight of her 
head on my shoulder. She looks as though she’s sleeping but 
she whispers, her voice thick with sleep, ‘I’m so glad you’re 
coming back again this evening.’

I LET MIEKO get o? at Shinagawa. I’ll be there in a little while, 
I tell her, I need to go back and freshen up at my grandparents’ 
house, change clothes. And to get the shampoo I bought for 
Mieko, I think to myself, I forgot it this morning, I left it in my 
room. 
I think I have a temperature. 
 
Back in Nippori, I glance automatically through the window of 
the Shiny. No sign of my grandfather. He must be down in the 
basement, in the storage area. I cross the street. The house is 
dark. At this time of day? Something must be wrong. With a 
growing sense of foreboding, I call out to my grandmother from 
the hallway. No response. The light switch in the entrance hall 
isn’t working. I feel my way up the stairs to the living room and 
turn on the light. 
 
Playmobil ?gures stand dotted about the room, their hands 
raised in applause. Their gaze is turned towards the table set 
with our three bowls, a platter of iced noodles in the centre, 
topped with the Bambi ?gurine. My grandparents are seated 
cross-legged on their cushions, my grandfather wearing a 
pointy cardboard hat. 
‘We’ve  made  you  noodles  for  long  life!’  my 
grandmother announces. 
Noodles, long ones, a Korean birthday tradition. 
‘I bought you some beer, and your grandfather boiled the 
water for the noodles!’ 
My  grandfather  elbows  her,  she’s  already  said  too 
much. 
‘You should’ve let me know …’ I mutter, caught o? guard. 
They gaze blankly at me. I mumble something about not 
being able to stay, that I have to go out, I’m going to be late, 
regretting every word as soon as I utter it. 
‘But you’ve been out all day,’ my grandmother says. ‘You’ve 
only just got home.’

I try and explain: Mieko and Henriette’s invitation, I’d have 
said no, if only I’d known. She cuts me o?. I hadn’t told them 
my plans either. I never tell them anything. She’s even bought 
a chocolate cake. And as if to emphasise the point, she goes 
into the kitchen and comes back with a cake, iced and 
decorated with the number thirty. 
It’s not my fault, I think to myself, if I don’t tell them 
anything. If I can’t speak to them in Korean. I can’t help  it if I 
live in Switzerland and speak French. I studied Japanese for 
their sakes. Because this is where they live and that’s what 
people speak here. 
‘Tomorrow?’ I mouth. 
‘Tomorrow  it won’t be your birthday any more.’ 
‘Let’s have it now, then.’ 
I sit down opposite my grandfather. He’s been staring at the 
noodles ever since I came in. I ?ll up our bowls. My 
grandmother is still standing, the cake in her hands. 
‘Please sit,’ I say. 
‘You don’t love me any more,’ she declares  stubbornly. 
‘Aigou …’ my grandfather sighs, his eyes still ?xed on 
the noodles. ‘Don’t be childish. Come along now.’ 
She sets the cake down on the ground, faces my grandfather 
and says: 
‘What do you know about anything? You’re oblivious to 
everything.’ And pointing at me, she adds: ‘Do you even know 
what she does all day long?’ 
My grandfather ?inches, cowering almost. 
She carries on. ‘She says she’s come here for our sakes, but 
she’s never here. She’s out all the time.’ 
‘That’s not true,’ I say, defending myself, ‘I’ve only seen 
Mieko four times.’ 
It is strange though, I feel I’ve known this child for a long 
time, that somehow I know her really well. 
‘And what’s more,’ I add, ‘she said she wanted to meet you. 
I’d have liked to bring her back here with me.’ 
‘So why didn’t you?’ my grandmother asks, suddenly very 
calm.

I look at her, ba?ed. On the platform at Shin-Okubo, when 
I’d mentioned the possibility of her meeting Mieko, she’d said 
no, hadn’t she? Or did she? I’d convinced myself she’d said no. 
Now I’m not so sure. One way or  the other, I can see now that 
it’s me that doesn’t want them to meet. The two of them 
speaking Japanese together. I wouldn’t be able to stand it, my 
grandmother telling Mieko her life story, just as she did with 
Mathieu. And me shut out again, unable to join in their 
conversation. 
‘If you’d rather,’ I say ?atly, ‘I could be your sandwich- 
board woman.’ 
My grandmother is tucking into the icing on the cake. The 
number thirty comes o? in chunks, the cake is starting to look 
like a ?eld of muddy snow. Her hands shake. My grandfather 
tips his chin to indicate that I can leave, that he’ll deal with 
her. I go down to the hall, on the verge of tears. Outside, the 
wind has picked up. Orange sky, streaked with lightning. A 
storm, but no rain. I have no desire to celebrate this birthday, 
even less to go out. I’m sweating. I’d like to sleep. 
From upstairs I hear my grandmother’s voice: ‘Have they at 
least made you some noodles?’ she rasps. 
 
As I close the door behind me, I hear her saying to my 
grandfather that it’s his fault, it’s all his fault, he dragged her 
to Japan,he let my mother leave, and now he’s driving me away. 
I make my escape, as fast as I can.

HENRIETTE AND MIEKO have dressed up for the occasion. 
Mieko is wearing a salmon-pink dress, Henriette a taupe- grey 
silk blouse. I’ve barely come in the door when Mieko 
announces that she has a present for me and goes down to her 
room to fetch it. Henriette pours me a glass of umeshu and 
starts preparing the salad. She hasn’t caught the sun as Mieko 
has, but her skin seems even drier than before. When she 
bends, her vertebrae protrude beneath her blouse. While 
Mieko is out of the room, I thank her for inviting me. 
‘It was Mieko’s idea,’ she says. ‘I 
might have guessed.’ 
She raises an eyebrow slightly. I can’t muster the energy to 
make amends for my lack of tact. Luckily Mieko comes back. 
She hands me an oblong package tied at either end, like an 
outsize bonbon. She wants me to open it straight away. I 
unwrap the gift. 
Two dolls made of bamboo sticks, with golf balls for heads, 
painted green and stuck on with Sellotape. Scraps of dried 
seaweed glued on for hair. It still smells of the sea. 
‘You and me, in green,’ she explains. 
She stares at my face to see my reaction. 
‘What did I tell you about the seaweed?’ Henriette says. 
‘But it’s to help them breathe. With chlorophyll.’ ‘I 
think they’re lovely,’ I mumble. 
‘They’re kokeshi dolls,’ Henriette explains. ‘People used to 
make them to remember the babies they killed because they 
couldn’t feed them. Mieko knows perfectly well. I’m very sorry.’ 
She sets the utensils on the table while I rewrap the dolls 
with exaggerated delicacy as  Mieko looks on, head down, 
completely still. 
Six crabs, arranged in a circle on a platter, a cup of white sauce 
in the centre. The platter takes up most of the table. Henriette 
uses a mallet to crack the crabs, striking them on the legs and 
the  body. She  hands us the claws, pieces of the shell still 
clinging to them. I enquire about their holidays. Their answers 
are polite but uninformative. I tell them how I spent mine.

taste  of  the rice drink made by the Indian couple in the 
traditional shopping street. I talk for a while and eventually 
grind to a halt. 
‘What’s this?’ Mieko asks, extracting a piece of 
transparent ?lament from a crab. She grimaces. 
‘It looks like moult,’ I say, ‘old skin.’ 
And then again, enunciating clearly for Henriette’s 
bene?t: ‘Moult.’ 
‘Moult,’ Mieko repeats, wrapping the piece of crab in her 
napkin. ‘I’ll keep it.’ 
‘No, don’t. It’ll go o?.’ 
I take it out of her hand and put it on my plate, while 
Henriette looks on in astonishment. I’m annoyed with myself 
for teaching Mieko this word, she won’t forget it. 
I go back to my food. The meal continues in silence. Outside, 
the wind moans. I fumble with the crab. Henriette passes me 
yet another claw. I shake my head. 
‘You don’t like it?’ 
‘I do, but I’ve had enough.’ 
Mieko pushes her plate away. 
‘Me too,’ she says. 
Henriette looks at her daughter, then at me: ‘I don’t 
like it either. None of us likes crab.’ 
She throws the claw back onto the platter. It lands with a 
splash. Henriette pays no attention. 
‘O? you go,’ she says, with a tilt of her chin. ‘Go and 
play.’ 
We go downstairs to the swimming pool. I open my bag, take 
out the shampoo and place it on the desk. Mieko stretches out 
on the bed in her usual position, prone with her head in the 
pillow. 
‘It’s not your fault,’ she says, her voice mu?ed. 
‘What’s not my fault?’ 
‘Mum being sad. It was Dad who liked to eat crab.’ 
She says she’d like to hear my dad playing the organ. I don’t 
have my laptop with me. And anyway, I re?ect, the only 
recording I have is the one my mother sent me, of him playing 
‘Happy Birthday’.

‘But he’s your dad!’ she says accusingly, turning round to 
face me. 
‘Next time.’ 
‘You always say that. And then we never do it. Like seeing 
your grandmother. Or the pachinko parlour.’ 
‘We went to Disneyland, didn’t we? And to Heidi’s Village.’ 
I try and explain to her that my grandmother is an old 
woman. She’s eight times as old as Mieko. She’s tired. Surely 
Mieko can understand that? 
‘And what is it about pachinko?’ I ask her. ‘It’s nothing but 
a tacky machine, a heap of plastic and old metal!’ 
Mieko doesn’t respond. After a while, she says that the balls 
that spurt out of the machines make her think of  ?sh eggs. 
Like tadpoles with no tails. She lowers her head. She’d like to 
touch them, see what they feel like. I sti?e a nervous laugh. 
She’s lying with her forehead jammed against the side of the 
pool, eyes closed. The holidays are almost over. She doesn’t 
want to go back to school. 
I sit down beside her, do what I can to reassure her, she 
doesn’t need to worry, she’s a bright kid. She turns her head 
towards me and I bend down and plant a kiss on her forehead. 
She pulls away and I sit upright, embarrassed. Of course. How 
could I forget? People don’t kiss in Japan. I’d acted 
spontaneously. 
‘I can’t stay,’ I tell her, getting up to leave. ‘But I’ll 
come back. Soon.’ 
‘Do you think he’s dead?’ she says quietly as I close the 
door. 
I freeze. She can’t see me from where she is. 
‘I’d prefer it if he was,’ she says. ‘At least I’d know 
where he was.’ 
I can tell from the rustling of sheets that she’s climbed 
under the covers. I close the door without a sound. 
 
Henriette is still at the table, a strong smell of seafood ?lling 
the room. She’s shelling crabs, piling the ?esh onto a plate, 
sucking at the claws, drawing out the juice.

She stops when she sees me. She looks down at the crabmeat: 
‘They’d go o? otherwise.’ 
I nod in acknowledgement and leave. 
 
I glance back at her from the hallway. Her back is turned, her 
shoulders shaking, arms pinned to her sides as she sobs in 
silence.

I COME DOWN with a fever. An ear infection. I try and call 
Henriette to let her know. She doesn’t pick up, I leave a voice 
message. 
My grandmother makes me rice porridge, watches me eat 
it, sighing plaintively. 
‘Aigou, yeppun seki … Poor baby, pretty little thing.’ 
I  turn  away,  repulsed by the word seki, a term usually 
applied to young animals. It makes me feel like a calf. I hear 
her creeping down the stairs, trying not to make a sound, 
opening the door a crack. She thinks I’m sleeping. If I stir, she 
shuts the door with a start. Sometimes she comes in, strokes 
my face, feels my forehead, my cheeks, touches my nose. Her 
?ngers feel like ?ies crawling on me but I don’t resist. I can’t 
muster the energy.  She opens the window to let in some fresh 
air, wants to give me medicine, caramel, stu? me full of honey. 
I’m worried that she doesn’t know what she’s doing. If only my 
mother were here, she’d know what to do. So would Mathieu. 
My head throbs. The smallest of sounds is painful. My 
grandparents’    footsteps  on   the   ceiling above   me,  the 
rumbling  of  car engines,   the  click  of   heels  on  the 
sidewalk.   The   pachinko  girl.     Her   voice.  Piercing. 
Repetitive. Stopping me from sleeping. I want to seize the 
boards, crush them against her chest, arrest the ?ow of 
words. I hear my grandmother telling my grandfather it’s his 
fault I’m ill. I hate to hear them arguing. It scares me. One 
evening, I go upstairs and ?nd my  grandfather asleep on the 
sofa, mouth open, teeth bared, hanging by 
a thread to receded gums. 
The infection doesn’t clear. My grandfather calls the doctor, 
who prescribes an antibiotic. Blood pounds in my head, all 
other sensations recede. After dinner,  I  sit  between my 
grandparents, watching television, unable  to hear. The news 
comes on, images of an earthquake. Aftershocks from last 
year’s perhaps. 
At night, my anxiety increases. I pull the covers up to my 
chin, in spite of the heat. If I need to get up to go to the toilet, 
I wait until I can’t hold on any longer.

LITTLE BY LITTLE, my hearing comes back. I don’t realise it  
at ?rst; I still hear only silence in the space that should be ?lled 
by the sandwich-board girl’s lament. Not until I leave the 
house, my brain still foggy from the infection, do I realise she’s 
not there. My grandfather has let her go. He’s removed the 
loudspeaker too. 
‘She wasn’t very good,’ he says by way of explanation. ‘And 
we’re going away soon, aren’t we?’ 
He asks me for the dates of our trip, wants to know if I’ve 
already bought the tickets. 
 
It’s happening, I write to Mathieu excitedly, it’s happening, 
we’re going. In ten days. 
 
I ask my mother to send me some clips of my father playing the 
organ. Mieko starts school in a week. I’ll go over and see her 
before we leave for Korea. 
 
I’m sleeping better. It’s suddenly much cooler, the 
temperature is back down to normal for early September. 
 
I haven’t heard from Henriette. I spend my days tidying the 
house. Vacuuming. Dusting. I’ve cleaned out the fridge, put the 
kimchi in the bin, washed the empty bento boxes, disinfected 
everything. I sort through my mother’s things in my bedroom, 
untangle the wires of the extension cords, throw out clothes 
that no one will ever wear again. Mieko’s dolls have lost their 
hair. I decide to discard the bamboo parts but keep the heads. 
I rinse them o? and put them in with my clothes to take back 
to Geneva with me. I ?nd some boards marked out in squares 
stashed away in a box, old Korean games, an assortment of 
pebbles and sticks. I pack them up. Maybe we’ll play them in 
the train, my grandparents will be able to teach me.

My grandmother sits in the living room surrounded by her 
Playmobil pieces, watching me work. She doesn’t understand 
why I’m doing so much tidying and organising, we’re only 
going for a few days. I explain to her that when you come back 
from a trip, it’s nice to ?nd your house clean and tidy. 
‘Yes, you’re right,’ she exclaims delightedly. ‘Aigou! 
What would I do without you?’ 
The bathroom is more of a challenge. I try organising at 
?rst, then decide to throw everything away: wipes, dried-up 
nail polish, cotton wool pads, mouldy creams that have started 
to resemble cottage cheese. 
 
One evening, my grandmother tries to pull out the Playmobil 
children’s hair using a pair of scissors. When her attempts at 
cutting fail, she stabs at them with the points of the blades. 
‘You’re bleeding!’ I say as I walk by. 
She stares at me in surprise. 
‘There, on your chin. Didn’t you feel anything?’ 
‘No.’ 
‘It didn’t hurt?’ 
She has a cut running all the way down her chin. I clean it, 
relieved to see it’s only a super?cial wound. My grandmother 
fusses over the dressing. No. She didn’t feel anything. Nothing 
at all. She picks up the Playmobil boy, rubs his head sheepishly, 
throws it back on the pile. I pick up the scissors to see if I can 
do any better. The plastic is surprisingly tough. 
‘See,’ she says, ‘old people aren’t the only ones to be goofy. 
You never take me seriously, do you?’ 
Gradually,  she too is overcome with the need to be busy 
organising. She makes piles of clothes, stu?s them  into 
suitcases, for herself and for my grandfather. Now I’m  the one 
pointing out to her that we’re only going for a week: it’s still 
warm, there’s no point in taking so many clothes. She gets 
annoyed, says she knows what she’s doing, I don’t know what 
I’m talking about, it can be very cold in Korea, the weather can 
change from one day to the next, all of a sudden it can feel like  
Siberia.

Sometimes she freezes, gazes at the suitcases, the bags of 
rubbish piled up in the hallway. She looks at me, stunned. She 
starts pulling out the things I’ve put aside  to throw away, says 
we have to keep them, the papers, creams, cotton wool pads, 
they’re hers, I have no right to put my paws all over them. She 
makes ?sts, aims at my back, as if she’s going to hit me. Then 
she changes her mind and puts everything back where it was. 
I’m right, she says, it’s time to throw these things out. 
 
My mother hasn’t replied to my request for recordings of my 
father.  She’s usually so quick to respond. And then one 
morning, a package from my mother arrives in the post. 
There’s a letter inside. She’s sorry it took so long, the ?les were 
too big to upload, they’ve saved them on CDs. 
‘What’s that?’ my grandmother asks looking over my 
shoulder. 
‘From Papa. For Mieko.’ 
I turn on the CD player in the living room. My father has 
really gone all out. There are four CDs. Everything from 
requiem masses to ?lm music:  Harry Potter,  The  Addams 
Family; improvisations, solemn tunes, baroque music, Vivaldi, 
a Poulenc concerto, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, songs: ‘Etoile 
des Neiges’, ‘Le Vieux Chalet’. My grandmother stands with 
her eyes closed, listening, arms out in front to balance, like a 
dancing bear at a fairground. I email my mother: does she 
realise there’s enough here for several whole days of listening? 
She says he just carried on and on playing. He wanted to send 
me all of it. He seemed so happy, she says, so happy.

TWO  DAYS  BEFORE  we’re due to leave, my grandfather  
comes home early from work. We eat alone, just the two of us, 
my grandmother has shut herself in the kitchen to make cakes 
for the journey. Aromas of honey and frying ?ll the house. She 
reappears around eleven with a bag of steaming kkwabaegi, a 
?fteen-litre bin bag. 
‘They’re the largest ones we have – I know it’s not very nice, 
but I couldn’t ?nd anything else to put them in,’ she says, 
setting the bag down at my feet. 
‘I’ll put them with our luggage.’ 
‘No, those are for her. I’m just about to make some for us. 
Not like that stu? from Family Mart. That child needs to eat 
fresh food.’ 
By the time I realise what she means, she’s already back in 
the kitchen. I try one of the doughnuts. It’s warm, crunchy. 
Henriette still hasn’t called back. I’ll go and see them 
tomorrow. 
There’s an empty space in my room where the boxes  were 
stacked. I feel disoriented. I can’t get to sleep. I try lying on 
the ?oor, climb back into the bed. I get up and go upstairs to 
the living room again. There’s nothing left for me to do. I move 
the suitcases around one last time and go out. 
I wander aimlessly up and down in front of the house, then turn 
into the street lined with shops selling leather goods. I walk 
past the clothing stores, headless mannequins glowing in the 
windows, lit by the headlights from passing cars. I press on, 
ready-to-wear shops gradually giving way to ateliers o?ering 
bespoke garments, bolts of leather stacked up inside, bulky 
and heavy. 
I retrace my steps, make my way back to Nippori. 
Next to McDonald’s, the Chinese man winds noodles around 
his arms, twisting them this way and that, like a marshmallow 
machine. A sumo wrestler dressed in a tracksuit rides past, 
pedalling a tiny bike, his topknot waxed and gleaming.

I arrive at the Shiny. My grandfather has unplugged the strings 
of lights, turned o? the neon lighting, the spotlights. With the 
shopfront darkened like this, I realise how badly lit this end of 
the street is, with its two meagre streetlights either side of the 
taxi rank. The main source of light here was the Shiny, 
attracting all the insects at night. 
I bring my face close to the window. With no one to play 
them, the machines seem pathetic. A single bulb glimmers 
weakly near the desk, the watchman just discernible in its dim 
glow. Pachinko balls. For Mieko. I could ask him to give me 
some, I won’t get another chance. Rain starts falling, ?ne and 
cold. Autumn rain, with a tang of rust. I realise the summer is 
over. 
 
I go into McDonald’s, order a co?ee and sit down by the 
window. Why so much neon lighting, I wonder, squinting to 
block out the glare. The co?ee has an odd, acidic taste. Rain 
lashes against the window. An old man comes in carrying a cup 
on a tray, his mouth twitching. He looks around for somewhere 
to sit. All the seats are taken. He goes up to the smoking ?oor. 
Without quite knowing why, I get up from my seat and follow 
him upstairs. He’s found somewhere to sit at the communal 
table, a sleeping man next to him on one side, a boy studying 
on the other. I’d like to tell him he can have my seat but I’d feel 
stupid, I don’t know him. I go back downstairs. 
My seat has been taken by a familiar-looking ?gure. Hair in 
braids, white trainers, tied in a double knot. I’ve never seen 
her without her sandwich boards before.  She’s shapelier than 
I imagined. She’s wearing a short- sleeved top. Eating a burger 
and fries. 
‘Excuse me.’ 
I lean down in front of her to pick up my tray. She moves 
back a fraction, still chewing. She shivers, goosebumps rising 
in little mounds on her smooth, hairless arms, like worms in 
wet sand.  
I stand there, wondering what to say, until it dawns on me that 
she’s utterly unaware of my existence. She walks over to the 
bin to throw away the remains of her burger before going back

outside onto the street. I watch her as she waits to cross the 
road, lit by the yellowish glow from the restaurant, the rain 
falling steadily on her. The light turns to green, she walks 
briskly across the road and disappears from view.

THAT NIGHT I DREAM of a human ?gure creeping through the 
streets, moving like a jackal along narrow alleyways, 
rummaging through rubbish bins. The city is deserted, it could 
be New Year’s, when everyone has gone to stay with family 
outside the city. The ?gure stops in front of every pachinko 
parlour and peers in through the window, then comes to sit 
outside the Shiny. The doors are closed, but the person is 
con?dent they’ll open again soon. Closed for maintenance. The 
Shiny will be open for business tomorrow. From inside the 
parlour, the watchman says something to the ?gure, his mouth 
opening and closing. I can’t make out the words. His coat 
pockets are ?lled with pachinko balls, all the balls from the 
machines that ?ll the Shiny.

IN SHINAGAWA, building work is under way. Sca?olding 
covers the future Promise Hotel, camou?aging the entrance. 
The lift system has been overhauled, the intercom has gone. 
No need to buzz anyone in the building, you simply go up. But 
the lift stops two ?oors before Henriette and Mieko’s. The only 
way to reach the apartment is by the emergency staircase. 
I go up and arrive at the ?re door. I knock. No answer. They 
must not have heard. The door isn’t locked, I step inside. I 
recognise the staircase, the one Mieko and I took to go up to 
the roof. Another ?imsier door opens directly into the kitchen. 
No one. A smell of garlic and parmesan hangs in the air. On 
the table, an opened bottle of royal milk tea. Books lie 
scattered on the sofa. Everything is bathed in a half-light. I 
walk along the corridor, darker and narrower now because of 
the tarpaulin covering the lift. 
I go down to the pool. 
 
On the yoga mat, Henriette is lying on her back holding her 
feet in her hands. She’s dressed in a pale pink bodysuit that 
covers her from neck to toe. The instructor’s voice murmurs 
soothingly from a laptop: 
‘Breathe in, breathe out. The “Happy Baby” pose.’ ‘It’s 
me,’ I call out from the guard rail, feeling quite 
foolish. ‘The door was open.’ 
Henriette lets go of her feet and raises herself up, 
slowly unfurling her limbs. 
‘We never see you any more,’ she says. 
‘I left you a message, I wasn’t well. You didn’t reply.’ 
She looks blankly at me. 
‘Don’t worry about it, though,’ I add hastily. 
‘Oh, yes … Are you feeling better?’ 
She smiles. 
‘Mieko’s at school,’ she says. 
‘I thought it started next Monday.’ 
‘Her school organises a camp, before term starts.’ 
‘Camp?’

     <text><![CDATA[ 
‘A camp,’ she says again. ‘A week of special activities. 
Intensive. So the children can all catch up.’ ‘I 
didn’t know.’ 
‘No reason why you should. You’re her teacher, not her 
mother.’ 
She stares at me for a moment. Then she steps onto the 
ramp and goes up the stairs. I follow her up. The bodysuit she’s 
wearing makes her muscles stand out. She holds herself 
upright – her carriage seems unnaturally sti? for someone who 
practises yoga. I wonder if she realises how anxious Mieko 
feels about school. I feel powerless, frustrated. 
When we get to the top of the stairs, she doesn’t invite me 
to go through into the living room. She says she doesn’t have 
anything she can o?er me to eat. 
‘I could make a quick trip to the convenience store,’ she 
says. ‘If you like.’ 
‘No need,’ I reply. 
 
Hovering between us, the image of Henriette, eating crab. ‘The 
building work’s started, I see,’ I say,  nodding  towards the 
tarpaulin across the lift. 
‘Yes?’ she says. ‘Was there something else?’ I 
fumble around in my bag for the CDs. 
‘They’re for Mieko,’ I say, handing them to Henriette. 
‘My father, playing the organ.’ 
‘Does Mieko like organ music?’ 
‘I don’t know. But I’d promised her. I wanted to give 
them to her before I leave for Korea tomorrow.’ 
‘With your grandparents?’ 
‘Yes. We’re going by boat.’ I describe our itinerary. 
‘You should have asked me for advice,’ she says. ‘I know the 
crossing to Fukuoka by heart. I did it dozens of times with my 
husband. Before Mieko was born.’ 
She gives me a kindly look. Almost maternal. Asks me if I’ve 
enjoyed my holidays. 
‘I wish I’d been able to ?t more in.’ 
‘I made you work too much.’

‘It didn’t feel like work,’ I confess, feeling slightly guilty. 
‘Not when I was with Mieko.’ 
‘We teachers spend our holidays preparing our classes, you 
know.’ 
‘I know,’ I say, thinking of Mathieu. ‘What will you be 
teaching this semester?’ 
She makes a sweeping motion with her hand. ‘Jean- Jacques 
Rousseau,’ she says, her speech rapid-?re. ‘A ?rst-year course, 
you’d ?nd it boring, most of the students don’t speak much 
French.’ 
She hesitates for a moment. Then she asks me if I  think 
Mieko would feel comfortable in Switzerland. 
‘I can’t really say …’ 
‘No, I don’t suppose you can,’ she concurs, speaking more 
slowly now. 
‘People get used to things,’ I add. ‘I 
worry about her sometimes.’ Silence. 
The moment passes. 
‘She wanted me to take her to the zoo,’ I say. 
‘Oh, yes … She likes animals.’ 
Her face takes on a warm glow as she says: 
‘I had a dog when I was small. At my parents’ house, in the 
country. When they died, he just wasted away. I’d get Mieko 
one, if I could, but it’s di?icult, up here at the top of this 
building. Some day, perhaps. Later.’ 
She tells me that Mieko ?nishes at four. Her school isn’t far, 
I can go and meet her and give her the CDs. 
‘She’ll be pleased to see you,’ she says ushering me towards 
the emergency exit.

I ARRIVE EARLY. The pupils are still in the playground, a  vast, 
concrete space. Hundreds of children. I never see any children 
on the streets. Where have they all come from? A group of boys 
are kicking a ball around, the girls huddled in groups around 
the benches. A hubbub of voices, the sounds all dampened on 
this side of the fence, even the thud of the ball as it bounces. It 
takes me a while to spot Mieko among the children. 
She’s on her own, drinking royal milk tea, circling the 
playground. Occasionally, she stops to peer at something, a 
detail, a rock perhaps or a crack in the wall. Green cap, fringed 
skirt. The school uniform makes her look thinner. It’s been ten 
days since we last met up. She’s not expecting me. It occurs to 
me that she might not recognise me, I should have worn 
something conspicuous. Such as? I stand close to the gates, in 
front of the mothers waiting to pick up their children. 
The bell rings. The children come out two at a time. To my 
relief Mieko walks over to me. She takes my hand, apparently 
not at all surprised to see me. 
‘So, how’s the new class?’ 
She pulls a long face. The class isn’t too bad, the 
atmosphere is a bit odd though. One of her friends killed 
himself during the summer. The year before, the teacher made 
him write ‘piggy’ on his homework instead of his name, 
because he was fat. 
She holds my hand, chattering as we walk. She doesn’t ask 
where I’m taking her. 
We take the train to Ueno Station. When she realises we’ve 
arrived at the zoo, she does a few skips. 
 
Gingko trees line the walkways. The nuts have ripened early 
because of the heatwave. Old men are collecting  the harvest, 
using long-arm grabbers to pick up the nuts that have fallen 
to the ground, dropping them into baskets they carry on their 
backs. Looking up, you can see the whale sculpture on the 
other side of the park, and the Museum of Natural History.

We amble from cage to cage, saving the deer for the end by  
unspoken agreement. Mieko has let go of my hand. I’m almost 
afraid to speak. We’ve  reverted to being  awkward in each 
other’s company, distant, as we were when we ?rst met. She 
smells of almonds; it’s nice, I say. This is the only shampoo her 
mother buys now, she replies. 
We come to the aviaries. Children throw corn to the pigeons 
in front of the vulture enclosure. The great bird stands on a 
lea?ess tree, its back turned to us, revealing only its legs, the 
shrivelled neck. Grains of corn land on its head, scatter on the 
ground beneath it. The vulture doesn’t stir. Crows descend and 
chase away the pigeons, cawing and ?inging themselves 
against the rails as they  peck at the corn. Eventually,  the 
vulture shakes out its body and climbs slowly along the branch. 
When it reaches the top, it stops, its head touching the rails, 
and stands completely still, its neck twisted at an awkward 
angle. 
Mieko walks over and gazes up at it. 
‘What are you doing there?’ she enquires softly. 
‘You see,’ I say, ‘this is why I don’t like zoos. Because  of the 
cages.’ 
She turns to face me. 
‘Me neither, I don’t like them.’ ‘I 
thought you’d enjoy it.’ 
‘So did I.’ 
‘Why did you want to come?’ 
‘You were the one who wanted to. Everything we’ve 
done was because you wanted to.’ 
She stares hard at me. I give in and say, ‘You didn’t 
make yourself clear.’ 
‘Calearo,’ she repeats. ‘Like your name. Calairo,’ she says, 
looking pleased with herself for having made the connection. 
 
The deer are clustered in one enclosure. Mieko climbs up on 
the guard rail and holds out her hand. 
‘Do you recognise any from Miyajima?’ I ask cheerily.

An image of the stu?ed deer in the museum ?ashes through 
my mind, these creatures’ fellow beings, frozen in time, the 
saccharine tones of the ?lm on evolution playing in an 
unending loop. 
Mieko stretches her arm out further.  The deer pay no 
attention, carry on grazing. I stand behind Mieko to make sure 
she doesn’t see as I take one of my grandmother’s kkwabaegi 
out of the bag and wave it in the direction of the deer. One of 
them sni?s the air listlessly, comes closer. Stops. Takes another 
step towards us. Mieko trembles. 
‘Onni, look …’ 
In her excitement, she turns to face me. I don’t have time to 
hide the doughnut. I try to look as if I’m eating it, but she’s not 
fooled. She turns back towards the enclosure; the deer has 
moved away. 
I place a hand on her back. 
‘You know, the deer in the zoo, they’re not very healthy.’ 
‘I’m the one who’s got something wrong with me,’ she says, 
detaching herself from my grasp. 
I can’t help laughing. She looks crestfallen. ‘It’s 
all lumpy, that doughnut,’ she says. 
I give it to her, show her my bag and say my grandmother 
has made lots of them for her. She sni?s it, says it smells good 
but doesn’t bite into it. 
‘I have some CDs of my father playing the organ too. I 
wanted to bring you some pachinko balls. But they’re heavy. 
Mucky. It’s not worth it, take my word. I swear. They’re not 
like you think they are. They’re not toys.’ 
She didn’t think they were toys, she says, her voice barely 
audible. But it doesn’t matter. 
‘I’m leaving tomorrow, you know. I’m taking my 
grandparents to Korea.’ 
‘Forever?’ she asks. 
I shake my head. She doesn’t respond. 
‘What’s the matter?’ I ask, my voice sounding unnaturally 
squeaky. 
She bites into a doughnut. Then she smiles at me. Nothing. 
She’s happy. She hopes we’ll like it, all the way over there.

IN THE TRAIN on the way back, we stand, amid the crush of 
rush-hour commuters, our bags wedged between our calves. 
Mieko is too short to hold the ceiling straps. I hang on to her 
by her jacket. 
‘I thought of something,’ she says after a few minutes. ‘We 
ought to shed our skins, like animals. The older we got, the 
more transparent our skin would become. In the end you’d be 
able to see all our insides through it. Veins, bones, feelings, 
everything. Our skin would be a mirror too, people would be 
able to see themselves in it. Eventually we’d become 
completely transparent, and when that happened, we’d give 
our last breath to our child.’ 
‘Our child?’ 
‘Yes. The one that goes on living after.’ 
‘After us?’ I say, correcting her. ‘Is that what you mean?’ 
She doesn’t respond. 
‘What if you don’t have any children? Or if you don’t want 
to have any?’ 
She thinks for a while. 
‘You still have to die,’ she says. 
 
We sway against each other as the train swings from side to 
side. 
Neither of us speaks for the next three stops. 
‘Would it be painful?’ I ask. 
‘No. We’d just get lighter and lighter, that’s all.’ 
 
At Shinagawa station I walk as far as the exit with her. I give 
her the CDs and the kkwabaegi by the main entrance.  The 
straps of her backpack are ?apping about loosely. She stands 
still while I tighten them for her. I tap 
her lightly on the shoulder when I’ve ?nished. 
‘We haven’t spoken much French …’ 
‘No.’ 
‘You can tell your mother if you want.’ 
‘Tell her what?’

‘That she’s a much better teacher than I am.’ 
Mieko gives me a funny look. I laugh, my hand still on her 
shoulder.  She giggles. And then we both start laughing 
hysterically. She wraps her arms round my waist. People give 
us a wide berth as they walk by. We laugh until we’re almost 
crying. 
‘You’re like a mum to me,’ Mieko says, burrowing her head 
into my stomach. 
She gives me a squeeze, then relaxes her grip. Before I have 
time to respond, she disappears into the crowd.

MY GRANDMOTHER SITS cross-legged on the seat, her hands 
pressed to the window. She’s no bigger than a child. Neither 
of them has said a word since we left the house. 
 
We change trains at Hiroshima and take the Japan Railways 
Sanyo line to Miyajimaguchi, where we pick up the ferry to the 
island of Miyajima. 
 
Our guesthouse looks out over the sea. The room we’re in has 
been recently refurbished. It smells of bamboo. From  the 
balcony you can see the ferry and the torii, the great red gate 
standing in the water. It looks more orange than red in this late 
afternoon light. The photos of it used in the tourist brochures 
have probably been retouched. 
 
My grandmother unrolls the futons, covers them with a sheet. 
I’m exhausted, I want to burrow under the sheet and not stir 
until morning, but if my grandmother goes to sleep now, she’ll 
wake us all up in the middle of the night. I suggest we go for a 
walk. 
 
Low tide. Ducks paddle in the shallow water.  The red 
boardwalks of Itsukushima Shrine ?ow out over the sand like 
a carpet of blood. At the entrance, visitors are funnelled past 
an orange box. A white plastic horse’s head sticks out above 
the box, empty-eyed. I stand on my tiptoes, trying to see the 
rest of its body, but all I can make out in the gloom is a manger 
?lled with coins. 
 
We stroll along the beach for a while before heading back to 
the village. On the square where the market stalls are, a gaggle 
of elderly people are trying to organise themselves for a group 
photo. There must be about thirty of them, all dressed in hiking 
gear and carrying knapsacks, shouting and gesticulating as 
they shu?e into place, smallest at the front, tallest at the back.

The photographer sees my grandparents, grabs them by the 
collar and steers them towards the group. 
‘They’re not with us, they’re not with us!’ the hikers cry 
indignantly. 
My  grandparents have instinctively obeyed the 
photographer’s instructions. They’re pushed from one member 
of the group to another before being expelled through a gap 
between two women in blue baseball caps. ‘Tsk, tsk!’ the 
women hiss. 
They scurry away from the group, clutching each other by 
the shoulder, nervously peering around in search of me. I usher 
them away and guide them towards an aquarium open to the 
public for a modest fee. 
A voice booms from a loudspeaker within the enclosure: 
‘Attention all visitors. The seal show is about  to begin!’ 
We sit down on a bench, eat some doughnuts. A family of 
deer approaches us. My grandmother feeds them her 
doughnut, holding it out with the wrapping still attached. They 
jostle for scraps. I tell her you’re not supposed to feed wild 
animals. She retorts that the doughnuts have gone soft, the 
deer are hungry. My grandfather gestures to me to leave her 
alone. She carries on feeding the deer while we look on. Other 
deer come right up to her, each one taking its turn. She tickles 
their heads as they feed, thrilled. 
 
We go to an eel restaurant for dinner. Posters of sumo stars on 
the walls. The grand championship has just ?nished in Tokyo. 
The scores are displayed on  a board. 
An old man sits o? to the side, alone, drinking his soup. A 
young American couple, just ?nishing their meal, stand up and 
glance over at us as they leave. I order eel with rice, sweet 
?esh that melts in the mouth. 
 
Later, my grandfather has a smoke on our bedroom balcony 
and I go out to join him. Behind the torii gate,  the last rays of 
the setting sun glimmer on the water, Hiroshima in shadow in 
the distance. We watch the ferry bringing back the commuters 
and the last tourists of the day from the other shore.

‘You don’t have to do this,’ he says to me in Japanese. 
I take a good look at him. His lined forehead, his movements 
weighed down by an immense fatigue, his breathing laboured. 
This trip might not work out the way I imagine, he says. I’d 
like to tell him that I’m not imagining anything, but he 
continues, punctuating his speech with lengthy pauses. 
‘When Korea was divided, we were still nationals of a uni?ed 
Korea. It was called Choson. At separation, the  Japanese 
government gave us permission to keep our Korean identity, 
but we had to choose between North and South. Many people 
chose the North, because of their family or because they 
considered the North more in line with our country’s traditions. 
There was no way of knowing how things would turn out. Your 
grandmother and I chose the South because we were from 
Seoul. That was the only reason. We knew nothing about any 
of the rest of it. Political questions meant nothing to us, the 
Cold War, Russia, the United States. Koreans who live in Japan 
have never known North and South Korea. We are all people of 
Choson. People from a country that no longer exists.’ 
He pauses. Then adds, ‘We do still have our language.’ 
I’m sorry I’ve forgotten how to speak it, I say in Japanese. If 
my mother hadn’t left to go abroad, if I’d been born somewhere 
other than Switzerland … He stops me. Asks me not to criticise 
my mother’s choices. He and my grandmother ?ed Korea so 
she could be born in a country free of war. He has always hated 
the Shiny. My mother grew up. She wanted to leave and she 
left. Their only desire was for her to live her life according to 
her own choices. 
He looks at me a?ectionately. And now, here I am, he 
says. I feel myself blushing. 
We stand there, side by side, for a while. My grandfather 
lights up another cigarette. Smoke coils around his face, the 
wind catching the halo as soon as it forms. A few moments 
later, I say I’m going out again, to stretch my legs a bit. 
 
I walk along the main street. The air feels chill, damp. I pull my 
jacket tighter. Grilles are drawn across the market stalls.

My mouth feels dry. I stop at a vending machine, weigh up the 
options. Co?ee with milk,  lemon  tea, corn soup, empty 
compartments. I lick my lips to moisten them. Beyond the walls 
of the aquarium the loudspeaker still blares. 
‘Attention all visitors! The seal show is about to begin!’ I 
imagine  groups  of  children  huddled  on  the  terraces, left 
behind by their parents after the last ferry has gone. 
 
The mountain rises beyond the village. In the shadows, a large 
building in the traditional style, curved roof, a hotel perhaps. 
Gravel gives way to greenery underfoot. The ferns make a 
rustling sound as I weave my way among them. Rusting copper 
containers lie on the earth. A pond, mosquitoes. I come to a 
gate, push it open and walk on, all the way to the building. 
Up close it seems much smaller, the façade crumbling. I use 
the torch on my phone to shine a light through one of the 
windows. A counter littered with debris, a dial phone. 
Shattered windowpanes, rooms emptied out. A kitchen. On the 
table, biscuit wrappers, a jar of pickles, greenish, ?oating like 
embryos. 
A haikyo. A building abandoned by the owners, left to fall 
into ruin, a cheaper option than demolition. Japan is littered 
with them. 
I back out. As I close the gate, I feel something wet brushing 
against my hand. I turn round with a start. 
A deer. Staring at me, warily, keeping its distance. Dirty 
thing, I mutter, my heart beating wildly, reassured nevertheless 
to know that I’m not alone. 
 
I go back to the village, forcing myself to walk slowly. Walking 
any faster would mean admitting that I’m scared. The deer 
follows me, stopping occasionally then trotting  a little faster 
to catch up. 
 
The aquarium has fallen silent. At the entrance, a woman is 
busy with a brush and a bucket. She bows low, disappears 
inside through a service entrance.

A MONOTONOUS LANDSCAPE of plains that dissolve on the 
horizon. Houses dotted about, lightweight boxes, scraps of 
wood, scattered like pawns across a chess board. Forests of 
trees bending in the wind. Inside the train, the air is still. The 
Shinkansen heads due south, the sky darkening as we advance. 
 
At the station in Hakata, we take the bus to the port of 
Fukuoka. The bus carries us through the business district, a 
residential area, wasteland. Cranes loom in the  mist, 
containers stacked up behind them. We  arrive at the 
embarkation quay. A large building, a wedding venue by the 
looks of it, with a restaurant, a ballroom and a portrait stage. 
My grandparents say they’ll wait here while I go and check us 
in. I know it’s merely a delaying tactic, a way to avoid meeting 
the other passengers. When I come back, I ?nd them in the 
restaurant. My grandmother has ordered soup, my grandfather 
a squid salad. 
I watch them as they eat. 
My grandmother swallows her food rapidly. My grandfather 
too, their movements in sync as they nourish their ageing 
bodies. How alike they are, I re?ect. They’ve lived alongside 
each other for so long, their features seem to merge into one 
another. 
 
The boarding area is crowded, the seats in the waiting room 
all occupied. Koreans everywhere: teenagers; a middle-aged 
couple; a baseball team, talking loudly, laughing. A boy spits. I 
can feel my grandmother beside me, the pressure of her hand 
in mine, her nails pressed to my palm. Damp. I squeeze her 
hand back. Outside, mist obscures the horizon. The ships in the 
port are scarcely visible, the containers like splashes of 
watercolour. 
‘My nails have turned black. Look.’ 
My grandmother waves her hand in my face. I push it away 
gently. 
‘That happens, you scratched the deer.’

My grandfather rubs her back to warm her up. He keeps 
standing up to check the locks on our suitcases, he’s afraid 
he’ll forget the code. The stewardess’s voice rings out, in 
Japanese, boarding will commence soon. The baseball players 
come back from the food stand with bottles of water, biscuits. 
My grandmother fusses. Maybe we should do the same, buy 
water, biscuits. I agree, without thinking. The stewardess is 
getting ready to open the access to the walkway. 
We stand motionless, all three of us, in the waiting area, 
watching her. My grandmother tightens her grip on me. 
‘You’re hurting me.’ 
‘I want to go home,’ she replies. 
‘That’s where we’re going.’ ‘This 
is the wrong way.’ 
‘No, it’s not,’ I say. ‘We’re going to Korea.’ 
She looks all round her again. 
‘I want to go home.’ 
I don’t know what to do. I make up an excuse about 
forgetting something in the restaurant and go back outside, 
onto the quayside. 
 
I call Mathieu. It’s four in the morning there. To my relief, he 
picks up. He’s back in Geneva, he’d left his phone on in case I 
needed him. I tell him they’ve changed their minds, they don’t 
want to go. Mathieu says nothing at ?rst. Then, quite simply, 
he asks if I want him to come over. 
‘No, I’ll come back to Switzerland. I can’t do any more here.’ 
‘Yes, you can,’ he says. ‘You should go. You’re the one who 
needs to go.’ 
‘If they don’t go back to Korea now, they never will. I can’t 
leave them by themselves, not here. What am I supposed to do? 
I can’t leave them on their own.’ 
Panic makes me talk faster and faster. Mathieu is 
unru?ed, his voice calm. 
‘They’ve been living there for ?fty years. They’d already 
been there for twenty years when you were  born.’

I cram my phone to my chest. The mist has turned to rain, 
falling steadily on the concrete. Crane drivers emerge from 
their cockpits and scurry into the warehouses. I raise the 
phone to my lips. Tell Mathieu that I’m going to Korea, I don’t 
know how long for. He may have to wait for me. He’ll wait, he 
replies. 
 
When I get back to the waiting area, all the passengers have 
gone. Only my grandparents remain; my grandmother is 
gesticulating, trying to tell the stewardess I’m on my way back. 
The stewardess catches sight of me, smiles and asks for our 
tickets.  We’re  late,  she says, it’s time to leave. I feel my 
grandmother shoving me from behind. 
‘Okay, okay, go, go!’ she chirps. 
I step onto the gangplank, clutch the handrail. The walkway 
feels slippery underfoot. A voice booms from the loudspeaker: 
welcome aboard, security instructions in Japanese ?rst, then 
in Korean. It’s hard to see the inside of the ship, there’s too 
much condensation. Passengers trace shapes on the portholes 
with their ?ngertips. 
Halfway along, I look back. My grandparents are rooted to 
the spot. The stewardess has closed the barrier. 
I freeze. My grandfather has his arm round my grandmother. 
She waves at me to say goodbye. I make a move in their 
direction, but I can see them mouthing:  ‘Go, go.’ 
 
I raise my hand high in the air, wave to them as I step onto the 
boat. The loudspeakers have fallen silent. 
All that lingers is an echo. A clamour of languages 
merging gradually to become one.

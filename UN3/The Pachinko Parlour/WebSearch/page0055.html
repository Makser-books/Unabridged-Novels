A theme park, based on the Ghibli studios’ animated version. Located in the prefecture of Yamanashi, near the Hokuto hills, two hours from Tokyo. I place the lea?et on the co?ee table, linger  over  the  shelf of children’s picture books. Geometric shapes, bright coloured squares and rectangles. Titles I don’t recognise, except for Ernest & Célestine. I’m sure I’ve read this one too, I think, as I open the book. Watercolours.  Beige wash. Ernest seems smaller than I remember him being. And little Célestine seems much bigger. They’re in the forest, putting up a tent, a homeless person comes to live in it. I’m startled to see how few words there are to a page. It seemed so long when my mother read it to me, there were so many words: Célestine going to school, reading books, stories within stories, Ernest falling in love with a polar bear he meets in the frozen north. There’s nothing of that here, either in the words or the pictures. Did my mother make it all up? I remember asking her to speak slowly, making sure what she said matched the words on the page. But I hadn’t learnt to read then, and when I did start reading by myself I’d lost interest in Ernest and Célestine.  The end, already. The homeless person moves out,  leaving presents for his mystery hosts. I close the book. A bear and a baby mouse. An odd pairing for a story. Célestine must have been an orphan, I suppose, her mother eaten by a cat. Now that I think about it, Ernest’s broad, vaulted back speaks of a burden of su?ering from long ago, from the time when he comforted Célestine, took her in. I’d never thought of it like that before.  Hearing the slip-slap of wet feet, I look up. Wrapped in her mother’s robe, Mieko sits down beside me. She points at the Heidi’s Village lea?et. ‘I went there on a school trip. It’s rubbish.’ ‘I wouldn’t mind going there.’ ‘I’m  warning  you,  it’s  for  little  kids.’   53

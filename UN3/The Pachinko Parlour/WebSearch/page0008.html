At the far end of the corridor, an open-plan living room with kitchen-diner. The stove takes up most of the room, along with the bookshelves. Beyond the picture window,  a haze of pollution blurs the contours of the metropolis below. I follow Madame Ogawa back towards the entrance. ‘Mieko’s room is downstairs,’ she says, indicating a door half-hidden by a coat rack. The door opens onto a concrete staircase. ‘Be careful,’ she says. ‘The light switch is at the bottom of the stairs.’ Her voice echoes slightly, as if in a cave. I feel my way down until the concrete gives way to a springier surface underfoot. The humidity rises. A neon light ?ickers on to reveal an open pit surrounded by a walkway with a waist- high glass barrier. The ?oor of the pit slopes gently down to a drainage hole. In one corner sits a single bed. Madame Ogawa places her hands on the guard rail. ‘The swimming pool. It’s never been used, even when the hotel was open. Mould. It’s clean now, since we had it drained. Mieko sleeps here, for the time being.’ I lean over the barrier to get a better look. Arranged around the bed, a desk and a chest of drawers, a yoga mat and a hoop re?ected to in?nity in mirrors on either side of the pool. Plastic blocks are arranged at the foot of the steps leading down into the pool. I can’t help thinking of the arcade game Tetris, with the geometrical shapes that drop down and have to be arranged in space. ‘Do you like yoga?’ Madame Ogawa asks. I tell her I don’t know, I’ve never tried it. She nods her head slowly. We go back upstairs. A little girl is waiting for us in the kitchen. Bobbed hair, shorts and a yellow T-shirt. She’s sweating, her fringe sticks to her forehead as she bows to greet me. ‘I bought salmon,’ she says to her mother, holding up a package of ready-made lasagne. It’s only ten in the morning, but Mieko starts setting the table while her mother shucks oysters and puts the lasagne in the microwave.   6

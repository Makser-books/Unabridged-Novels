MY GRANDFATHER is spooning his food into his mouth faster than usual. He spills some soju, pushes away the napkin I o?er him. My grandmother has already left the table and is sitting on the sofa pretending to read a magazine. She went missing yesterday, while I was out at Disneyland. She set o? by train for Shin-Okubo, where the Korean shops are, in search of long noodles. She didn’t recognise the station and stayed on the train, going round and round on the Yamanote line over and over again. My grandfather assumed I was with her. I called the police as soon as I got home. You need to wait for a while, they said, old people are unpredictable, they often act on a whim. In the end, a Japan Railways employee brought her back home; he’d found her in one of the seats reserved for elderly people, asleep. ‘All that for a few noodles,’ my grandfather grumbles. ‘I’ll go with her next time,’ I say under my breath. ‘I can go by myself,’ my grandmother protests. Looking at them, I feel overwhelmed. Their lives begin and end with the pachinko parlour. The only social interactions they have are to do with exchanging balls for trinkets: one hundred balls, a bottle of water; one thousand balls, a bar of chocolate; ten thousand balls, an electric razor; no balls, a pack of chewing gum, the consolation prize. They don’t socialise at all with other Zainichis, Japan’s Korean community: exiles, people who came, as my grandparents did, to escape the Korean war, and others, who were deported during the Japanese occupation of Korea. ‘We need to organise things for the trip,’ I say tentatively, almost to myself. ‘I still haven’t booked our tickets.’ My grandfather complains that he can’t leave the pachinko parlour in the middle of the season. I remind him  that  we’d planned  to  go  for  one  week  only,  at  the  beginning of September. He’ll think it over, he says. We can discuss it again tomorrow. It’s time for the service. And slipping into a well-established routine, my grandparents push the co?ee table to one side and place two cushions in front of the television set tuned to KBS World, the Korean channel that broadcasts the weekly church service. 22

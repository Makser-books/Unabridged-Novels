They sit cross-legged on the ?oor, Bibles in hand, following along attentively. When it’s time for  the hymns they both join in the singing, my grandmother’s voice strong and full, my grandfather’s a wavering vibrato. My grandmother looks up, lost; my grandfather helps her ?nd her place, keeping time with his index ?nger. They’re completely absorbed, unaware of my presence. On the table, our three bowls make the shape of a face. My grandparents’, the two eyes; mine, the mouth, rounded as if in astonishment. I clear them away and get on with the washing up. When I’ve ?nished, I help  myself  to a beer and go downstairs to my room. I’ll have to stop doing this soon. I can’t go on using jet lag as an excuse for knocking myself out like this for much longer.  My mother has messaged me. My birthday is still two weeks away but she wanted to make sure I read this in time. They love me lots, I’m their pet, their little chicken, they send me hugs. There’s an audio attachment. A clip from a radio programme, a recording of the classical music festival in Verbier. An organ solo, in a church. A piece I don’t know. The last few bars. A pause. People clap, the organ strikes up again. It’s playing ‘Happy Birthday’. The commentator is surprised, mumbles something about it apparently being someone’s birthday today, urges everyone to celebrate with the unknown person. The applause grows louder. Someone shouts: ‘Hooray.’ There’s a picture with the message. My father, at the organ, photographed from behind, my mother in the foreground, a sel?e. She’s smiling, features distorted by the perspective: double chin, mouth enlarged, forehead shrunk. I take a good look at the picture. Swipe it away quickly to save it. I have a message from Mathieu too. He’s in the village, he’s come down the mountain to send me this message. He says he misses me, he thinks I’d like the chalet, you can lie in bed and gaze at the Dent Blanche. Has my grandfather managed to reduce his hours?  23

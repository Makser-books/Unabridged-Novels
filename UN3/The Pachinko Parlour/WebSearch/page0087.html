We amble from cage to cage, saving the deer for the end by  unspoken agreement. Mieko has let go of my hand. I’m almost afraid to speak. We’ve  reverted to being  awkward in each other’s company, distant, as we were when we ?rst met. She smells of almonds; it’s nice, I say. This is the only shampoo her mother buys now, she replies. We come to the aviaries. Children throw corn to the pigeons in front of the vulture enclosure. The great bird stands on a lea?ess tree, its back turned to us, revealing only its legs, the shrivelled neck. Grains of corn land on its head, scatter on the ground beneath it. The vulture doesn’t stir. Crows descend and chase away the pigeons, cawing and ?inging themselves against the rails as they  peck at the corn. Eventually,  the vulture shakes out its body and climbs slowly along the branch. When it reaches the top, it stops, its head touching the rails, and stands completely still, its neck twisted at an awkward angle. Mieko walks over and gazes up at it. ‘What are you doing there?’ she enquires softly. ‘You see,’ I say, ‘this is why I don’t like zoos. Because  of the cages.’ She turns to face me. ‘Me neither, I don’t like them.’ ‘I thought you’d enjoy it.’ ‘So did I.’ ‘Why did you want to come?’ ‘You were the one who wanted to. Everything we’ve done was because you wanted to.’ She stares hard at me. I give in and say, ‘You didn’t make yourself clear.’ ‘Calearo,’ she repeats. ‘Like your name. Calairo,’ she says, looking pleased with herself for having made the connection.  The deer are clustered in one enclosure. Mieko climbs up on the guard rail and holds out her hand. ‘Do you recognise any from Miyajima?’ I ask cheerily.                85

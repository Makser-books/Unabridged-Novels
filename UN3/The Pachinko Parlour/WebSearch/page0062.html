A  sign  in gothic-style lettering on the façade of the town hall: ‘Zürich’. Except for the old people, who’ve disappeared up the stairs between the tower and the church, Mieko and I are the only ones  here. We climb the stairs. They lead to a miniature train station, the platform lined with a single long bench. The rails disappear into an area of dense greenery, criss- crossed with walkways. The bell tower strikes eleven. There’s a smell of cut grass. ‘Can’t we walk?’ I ask Mieko, who’s already sitting down. ‘No.  But there’s the train. It’s coming now,’ she says, pointing towards the far side of the park. Shielding my eyes with my hand I can just make out a red train carriage winding its way through a ?eld of sun?owers. Around it, old men are at work, harvesting, watering, clearing the ground. Piped music ?lls the  air.  Familiar-sounding. ‘Edelweiss’ from  The Sound of Music. Mieko cranes forward, gazing intently at the pond on the other side of the track. ‘Look at that grey ?sh, the one with white spots. It’s a cleaner ?sh. Did you know they keep on getting bigger, for the whole of their lives?’ ‘I know. I had one in my ?sh tank when I was little.’ ‘They can’t grow up properly when they’re in an aquarium. They don’t live as long, they die when they’re still no bigger than babies.’ I tip my chin in acknowledgement. That wasn’t the reason my ?sh died. I was thirteen, just starting at middle school. For some reason I’d become obsessed with having an aquarium. My parents were sceptical at ?rst but in the end,  they  bought me  a  thirty-litre  tank,  with  a  pair  of guppies, four neon tetras and a pleco. The salesperson said the pleco would clean up all the algae and other impurities in the tank. It didn’t quite work out that way. The algae spread all over the tank and before long it obscured everything. I despaired as I watched the ?sh die one by one, all except the pleco. I thought it was probably very happy to have so much food all to itself. But the pleco died too and after that we grew cacti. I found out later that I’d been misinformed. Plecos need more than algae in their diet.  60

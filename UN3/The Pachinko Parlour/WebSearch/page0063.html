I should have given it special food, just like the other ?sh, with specially adapted nutrients.  The train pulls in, two old men get o?, we climb in. We’re o?, the pace so slow it’d be quicker to walk. The driver, in his peaked cap, stares straight ahead. We’ve barely travelled a hundred metres when he applies the brakes and calls out: ‘Fifteen-minute halt.’ The attraction we’re visiting is a log cabin, Heidi’s grandfather’s. A chain slung across the open door bars visitors from entering. We stand in front of the display, a single room with a wooden table on which pieces of arti?cial food are arranged, with labels written in Japanese: ‘cheese’, ‘meat’, ‘bread’. A ladder leads up to the loft where Heidi sleeps. Mieko examines the exhibits carefully, putting on a show of attention for her guest who is seeing it for the ?rst time. I look around the cabin. Cut-out rabbits stand on the bare earth at the back, holding up a placard, warped by sunlight. ‘Sorry, we are absent due to maintenance’ it reads, in English. I feel a migraine coming on. I’m only too glad to get back on the train and ?nd some shade even though the heat is even more intense under the metal roof of the carriage. Meanwhile, the village square has come to life. In the restaurant, women fuss over a fondue pot, their movements visible through the orange-tinted steam. Mieko and I sit down on the steps of the church. With a bloom of sweat on her she looks like a doll, brand new, still wrapped in plastic. She turns to face me, asks for my permission to go back to the garden. ‘Yes, you can go.’ She walks with heavy steps towards the stairs. I lean back against the wall of the church and feel it shudder. I peer through a stained-glass window and realise it’s only a façade, made of plaster, supported by a metal frame. I do a tour of the shop. On o?er are ?gurines,  cows  made  of  wood with red or black spots. They remind me of my ?rst school trip, to a farm in Appenzell.   61

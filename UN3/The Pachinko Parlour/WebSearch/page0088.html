An image of the stu?ed deer in the museum ?ashes through my mind, these creatures’ fellow beings, frozen in time, the saccharine tones of the ?lm on evolution playing in an unending loop. Mieko stretches her arm out further.  The deer pay no attention, carry on grazing. I stand behind Mieko to make sure she doesn’t see as I take one of my grandmother’s kkwabaegi out of the bag and wave it in the direction of the deer. One of them sni?s the air listlessly, comes closer. Stops. Takes another step towards us. Mieko trembles. ‘Onni, look …’ In her excitement, she turns to face me. I don’t have time to hide the doughnut. I try to look as if I’m eating it, but she’s not fooled. She turns back towards the enclosure; the deer has moved away. I place a hand on her back. ‘You know, the deer in the zoo, they’re not very healthy.’ ‘I’m the one who’s got something wrong with me,’ she says, detaching herself from my grasp. I can’t help laughing. She looks crestfallen. ‘It’s all lumpy, that doughnut,’ she says. I give it to her, show her my bag and say my grandmother has made lots of them for her. She sni?s it, says it smells good but doesn’t bite into it. ‘I have some CDs of my father playing the organ too. I wanted to bring you some pachinko balls. But they’re heavy. Mucky. It’s not worth it, take my word. I swear. They’re not like you think they are. They’re not toys.’ She didn’t think they were toys, she says, her voice barely audible. But it doesn’t matter. ‘I’m leaving tomorrow, you know. I’m taking my grandparents to Korea.’ ‘Forever?’ she asks. I shake my head. She doesn’t respond. ‘What’s the matter?’ I ask, my voice sounding unnaturally squeaky. She bites into a doughnut. Then she smiles at me. Nothing. She’s happy. She hopes we’ll like it, all the way over there. 86

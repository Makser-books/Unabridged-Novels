My mother and  I  had covered up the last square, Zürich Paradeplatz, for fun, and written Yverdon-les-Bains on it in indelible felt-tip. Our own Pestalozzi Square, transformed into the most expensive real estate in Europe. ‘You  see,’ I’d explained to my grandmother,  who didn’t understand why we were laughing, ‘it’s as if Mum was saying that we live in like, I don’t know, Manhattan, or the Champs-Élysées in Paris.’ ‘Okay,’ she said, ‘Paris, okay, okay, Paris …’ Madame Ogawa pulls out more photos and waves them about in the same way before showing them to me. Lausanne Cathedral, the Federal Palace, the Bear Pit. ‘You see,’ she says, ‘I can’t send Mieko over there until she’s mastered the language.’ ‘She can learn it while she’s there …’ ‘No, that’s out of the question. The standard in Swiss schools is very high, she wouldn’t be able to keep up.’ Her voice hardens. ‘Perhaps she’d never be able to ?t in. Like you, here. You’ll never really be able to speak Japanese, will you?’ I’m speechless. Every conversation we’ve had has been in Japanese. I try to catch her eye but she’s turned away to look out the bay window. The city is su?used with  light, Mount Fuji drained of colour. The sun’s last rays ?lter through the spaces between buildings. ‘I didn’t know your parents ran a pachinko parlour,’ she says eventually. ‘My grandparents. Why would you know?’ ‘Couldn’t they ?nd work where they lived?’ ‘In Korea?’ She inclines her head as if to say yes, of course. ‘Gambling’s  illegal  in  Korea.  They’re  ?ne  here.  They have plenty of work.’ I choose my words carefully. Gambling for money is illegal in Japan too. Pachinko isn’t seen as gambling because the balls are exchanged for sweets, toilet paper,  bottles of water, toothpaste. Or dominoes. People swap them for money once they leave the parlour. Anonymously, through a hole in the wall,   32

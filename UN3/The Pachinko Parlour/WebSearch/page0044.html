We set it up on the low table. My grandmother chooses the wheelbarrow, I take the thimble. It’s been twenty years since we last played. I read through the instructions to remind myself of the rules. My grandmother immediately starts installing hotels wherever she lands, whether she owns the property or not. She doesn’t like the houses, she says, they’re too small. ‘That’s one of mine,’ I say. She rolls the dice, dislodging the buildings. ‘You see,’ I say, ‘they’re righting themselves of their own accord.’ No response. She’s too engrossed in the game. She throws a double, moves her wheelbarrow to the ‘just visiting’ square, throws again. Another double. This time she lands on Lausanne, Rue du Bourg. She buys it. Throws again for the third time. ‘Double sixes!’ she cries. ‘You see! It’s my lucky day!’ ‘Well, no, actually,’ I say, after a quick glance at the rules. ‘On the third double you have to go to jail.’ ‘Why? I haven’t done anything wrong!’ ‘That’s the game. The rules. It’s all the luck of the dice.’ ‘You’re just jealous,’ she complains. ‘You’re cheating.’ I can’t show her the proof, the rules are written in French, German and English, languages she doesn’t understand. She has a choice between paying to get out or waiting for three goes. ‘That’s no fun,’ she says. I let her have her way. It would make more sense to play with three people. With my mother. My grandmother says she wants to start the game again. I go to prison in her place. Better to let her play on and keep the game going. I swap our pieces round. The ice cubes have melted in the jug. Water ?oats above the milk. I stir it with my spoon. The tea turns cloudy, opaque. I take a sip. It tastes like Mieko’s royal milk tea, a little less sweet, perhaps. When I look up, my grandmother is staring at me. ‘Is it my turn?’ I ask. She asks me how I am. 42

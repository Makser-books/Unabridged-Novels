I COME DOWN with a fever. An ear infection. I try and call Henriette to let her know. She doesn’t pick up, I leave a voice message. My grandmother makes me rice porridge, watches me eat it, sighing plaintively. ‘Aigou, yeppun seki … Poor baby, pretty little thing.’ I  turn  away,  repulsed by the word seki, a term usually applied to young animals. It makes me feel like a calf. I hear her creeping down the stairs, trying not to make a sound, opening the door a crack. She thinks I’m sleeping. If I stir, she shuts the door with a start. Sometimes she comes in, strokes my face, feels my forehead, my cheeks, touches my nose. Her ?ngers feel like ?ies crawling on me but I don’t resist. I can’t muster the energy.  She opens the window to let in some fresh air, wants to give me medicine, caramel, stu? me full of honey. I’m worried that she doesn’t know what she’s doing. If only my mother were here, she’d know what to do. So would Mathieu. My head throbs. The smallest of sounds is painful. My grandparents’    footsteps  on   the   ceiling above   me,  the rumbling  of  car engines,   the  click  of   heels  on  the sidewalk.   The   pachinko  girl.     Her   voice.  Piercing. Repetitive. Stopping me from sleeping. I want to seize the boards, crush them against her chest, arrest the ?ow of words. I hear my grandmother telling my grandfather it’s his fault I’m ill. I hate to hear them arguing. It scares me. One evening, I go upstairs and ?nd my  grandfather asleep on the sofa, mouth open, teeth bared, hanging by a thread to receded gums. The infection doesn’t clear. My grandfather calls the doctor, who prescribes an antibiotic. Blood pounds in my head, all other sensations recede. After dinner,  I  sit  between my grandparents, watching television, unable  to hear. The news comes on, images of an earthquake. Aftershocks from last year’s perhaps. At night, my anxiety increases. I pull the covers up to my chin, in spite of the heat. If I need to get up to go to the toilet, I wait until I can’t hold on any longer.   72

It comes out steaming and she serves large portions to Mieko and me, a smaller one for herself. She’s taken o? her jacket. Her T-shirt clings to her ribs, the points of her nipples. A vein bulges along her arm from shoulder to wrist. Desiccated, I think to myself, like everything else about her. The lasagne sheets slither o? her chopsticks into the pink béchamel sauce. She ?shes them out again deftly. From time to time I bite into something that feels solid, the salmon probably. Mieko ?nishes eating and leans back in her chair, her mouth opening and closing like a ?sh. Madame Ogawa dabs at her lips with her napkin, folds it back up. ‘If you could take her out once in a while too …’ ‘Of course.’ ‘I was thinking … Perhaps you could go and play ?rst?’ ‘Okay.’ I’m not sure I’ve understood what she means by ‘play’. In Japanese, ‘play’ can be used for all sorts of things, from children’s games to evenings out with work colleagues. In Korean too. I’ve no idea what children like to do. I’m in my late twenties, I’m not used to being around  ten-year-olds.  I’m beginning to wish I hadn’t  answered that ad. ‘Native French speaker wanted in Tokyo to tutor ten-year-old during summer holidays.’ I’d seen the ad in Geneva, on Tokyo’s  Sophia University website. Madame Ogawa was a French teacher herself, she’d be busy preparing for the next school year. She didn’t want her daughter spending too much time on her own. I’d been planning to spend the month of August in Tokyo with my grandparents, before travelling to Korea with them at the beginning of September. I was concerned I might have too much time on my hands. I accepted Madame Ogawa’s o?er and we agreed that I’d meet up with Mieko now and then during my stay. Madame Ogawa cleans her plate and glances over at mine. ‘You don’t like it. Have some oysters.’ ‘No, no, it’s good,’ I say, forcing down a mouthful of lasagne. She clears away the lasagne plates and Mieko places an oyster in front of me.  7

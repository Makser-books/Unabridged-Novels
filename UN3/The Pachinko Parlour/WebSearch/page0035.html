somewhere near the pachinko parlour.  ‘They must miss their country.’ ‘No, they don’t,’ I lie. ‘And it’s so close. Barely a two-hour ?ight,’ she presses on. ‘It’s not as simple as that.’ Although it is, I think to myself. My grandparents would never ?y, but they could go by train, by boat. Tokyo. Nagoya. Kyoto. Shin-Osaka. Hiroshima, Hakata. Three hours by ferry to Busan, train to Seoul. Simple. Madame Ogawa shu?es the photos: ‘I have nothing against pachinko as such. But children are often left in the street while their mothers are playing, and when things don’t go so well for the parents, their children sometimes have to go without food.’ ‘It’s not like that at my grandparents’,’ I say, humiliated at being forced to defend them. ‘Of course not.’ She goes to say something, hesitates. I’m tempted to say more, to invent stories about gangsters, but I can understand why she thinks the way she does. I make a point of assuring her that I won’t take her daughter there, fully aware that I’ve just promised Mieko the opposite. Visibly relieved, Madame Ogawa turns to the window. I can see from our re?ections that she’s trying not to look at me. She gazes o? into the distance, somewhere towards Tokyo Tower, the one shaped like the Ei?el Tower. ‘In the end, it’s no worse than … Nippori’s not such a bad place to live. The hillside is stable, safe from earthquakes. That’s why they built the cemetery there.’ ‘Mieko told me about her father.’ Silence. ‘What did she tell you?’ ‘Not much.’ Madame Ogawa smiles sadly. ‘You know, in Japan, thousands of people disappear every year. There are businesses you can go to, to get a new identity.’ She turns back to face me.  33

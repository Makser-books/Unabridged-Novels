HENRIETTE AND MIEKO have dressed up for the occasion. Mieko is wearing a salmon-pink dress, Henriette a taupe- grey silk blouse. I’ve barely come in the door when Mieko announces that she has a present for me and goes down to her room to fetch it. Henriette pours me a glass of umeshu and starts preparing the salad. She hasn’t caught the sun as Mieko has, but her skin seems even drier than before. When she bends, her vertebrae protrude beneath her blouse. While Mieko is out of the room, I thank her for inviting me. ‘It was Mieko’s idea,’ she says. ‘I might have guessed.’ She raises an eyebrow slightly. I can’t muster the energy to make amends for my lack of tact. Luckily Mieko comes back. She hands me an oblong package tied at either end, like an outsize bonbon. She wants me to open it straight away. I unwrap the gift. Two dolls made of bamboo sticks, with golf balls for heads, painted green and stuck on with Sellotape. Scraps of dried seaweed glued on for hair. It still smells of the sea. ‘You and me, in green,’ she explains. She stares at my face to see my reaction. ‘What did I tell you about the seaweed?’ Henriette says. ‘But it’s to help them breathe. With chlorophyll.’ ‘I think they’re lovely,’ I mumble. ‘They’re kokeshi dolls,’ Henriette explains. ‘People used to make them to remember the babies they killed because they couldn’t feed them. Mieko knows perfectly well. I’m very sorry.’ She sets the utensils on the table while I rewrap the dolls with exaggerated delicacy as  Mieko looks on, head down, completely still. Six crabs, arranged in a circle on a platter, a cup of white sauce in the centre. The platter takes up most of the table. Henriette uses a mallet to crack the crabs, striking them on the legs and the  body. She  hands us the claws, pieces of the shell still clinging to them. I enquire about their holidays. Their answers are polite but uninformative. I tell them how I spent mine.  Walks behind the cemetery in Nippori, the lounging cats, the 68

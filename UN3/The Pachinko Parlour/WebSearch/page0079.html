TWO  DAYS  BEFORE  we’re due to leave, my grandfather  comes home early from work. We eat alone, just the two of us, my grandmother has shut herself in the kitchen to make cakes for the journey. Aromas of honey and frying ?ll the house. She reappears around eleven with a bag of steaming kkwabaegi, a ?fteen-litre bin bag. ‘They’re the largest ones we have – I know it’s not very nice, but I couldn’t ?nd anything else to put them in,’ she says, setting the bag down at my feet. ‘I’ll put them with our luggage.’ ‘No, those are for her. I’m just about to make some for us. Not like that stu? from Family Mart. That child needs to eat fresh food.’ By the time I realise what she means, she’s already back in the kitchen. I try one of the doughnuts. It’s warm, crunchy. Henriette still hasn’t called back. I’ll go and see them tomorrow. There’s an empty space in my room where the boxes  were stacked. I feel disoriented. I can’t get to sleep. I try lying on the ?oor, climb back into the bed. I get up and go upstairs to the living room again. There’s nothing left for me to do. I move the suitcases around one last time and go out. I wander aimlessly up and down in front of the house, then turn into the street lined with shops selling leather goods. I walk past the clothing stores, headless mannequins glowing in the windows, lit by the headlights from passing cars. I press on, ready-to-wear shops gradually giving way to ateliers o?ering bespoke garments, bolts of leather stacked up inside, bulky and heavy. I retrace my steps, make my way back to Nippori. Next to McDonald’s, the Chinese man winds noodles around his arms, twisting them this way and that, like a marshmallow machine. A sumo wrestler dressed in a tracksuit rides past, pedalling a tiny bike, his topknot waxed and gleaming.  77

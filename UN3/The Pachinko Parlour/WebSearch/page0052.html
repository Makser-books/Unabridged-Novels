I decided it could be a job, being a chlorophyll splitter. That’s what I wanted to do when I grew up.’ ‘Why didn’t you?’ ‘I started thinking about splitting atoms and about that being a way of making atomic bombs.’ Mieko is quiet for a few minutes, thinking. ‘How old are you, actually?’ ‘Thirty.

She hates her father, she says, he only worked on building those trains so he could run away from her and her mother. She stands, folds up our towels, her movements uncharacteristically harsh. ‘I’m hungry,’ she declares. ‘Let’s go back down.   50

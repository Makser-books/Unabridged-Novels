On the table by the bed iss a photo of my grandmother aged about  ten,  with  plump  cheeks  and  round  belly,  taken  just   before the Second World War. Her mother stands behind her, one hand on her shoulder. Dressed in the traditional white linen costume, they pose proudly. It was rare for women to have their picture taken in Seoul in those days. Over the years the white of their costume has taken on a dull tinge, a yellowish hue that speaks of mourning in both Korea and Japan. I lie on the bed, wriggle out of my clothes. My feet protrude beyond the end of the bed. It’s too hot. The polyester sheets cling to my stomach. In the end, I unroll one of the tatami mats, cover it with a sheet and lie on the ground, trying to ?nd a cool spot. Noises drift in from the street. Car exhausts, heels on the tarmac, and all night long, the sandwich-board woman’s monotonous chant, relayed on playback through a loudspeaker. The window is at street height. Lying on the ground, I can see people’s legs as they hurry past, heading for the narrow streets of Uguisudani, where the love hotels are. I’ve never been inside one. I can’t help thinking about the girls who work there, the men in grey suits. Most of the girls are much younger than I am. I picture the street. I know every inch of it, I’ve walked down it so often on my way to Ueno Park. The Schall, with its cut-out black bat on the roof. The Transatlantic. The Mont Blanc, with its jacuzzis. The Dream. Further along, you come to the bento box stall with its panda- shaped scales, walk over the bridge above the railway lines, pass the man in his makeshift canvas shelter, skirt along the cemetery as far as the whale statue in front of the Natural History Museum, and eventually arrive at Ueno Park. Starbucks, the University of the Arts, then the zoo. Through the ceiling, I hear my grandmother laughing. I open my laptop and check my emails. My  friends gave up writing to me ages ago, I took too long to reply.  Mathieu probably has too weak a signal. He’s house- sitting a chalet in Val d’Anniviers, writing up his thesis. And my mother? Has she messaged me? She usually keeps me up to date on where my 14

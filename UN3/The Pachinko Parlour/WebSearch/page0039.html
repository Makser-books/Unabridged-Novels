SHIN-OKUBO, Tokyo’s Koreatown. Life-size cut-outs of pop singers and soap stars, shops selling cosmetics. The pavements heave with Japanese teenagers. Food trucks stretch for a hundred metres, Japanese teens queue for dakkochi. A spicy, caramel smell. Shin-Okubo, one long skewer of grilled chicken. We’ve walked the entire length of the street without ?nding my grandmother’s usual hair salon. Tra?ic sweeps past on the main road, the towers of stylish Shinjuku rising on the other side. My grandmother wants to cross the road, keep searching. I tell her we’ve come  to the end of Koreatown, the salon must have closed down, we need to turn back. ‘You don’t like my hair anyway,’ my grandmother grumbles. ‘You’re always giving me that funny look.’ ‘That’s nonsense,’ I say. I apologise immediately. I’m overtired. It’s the heat. The sandwich-board woman. I can’t stand it, she keeps me awake at night. The loudspeaker crackling. My grandmother tugs at my sleeve and says something in my ear. I should treat the girl nicely. She used to work in a bar as a hostess. Her father came in drunk one evening. He made advances to her, not realising she was his own daughter. She pushed him away and he broke a bottle over her head. ‘She’s a bit soft in head, you know,’ my grandmother says, tapping at her temple. ‘We’ve had her since January.’ ‘She must get so cold,’ I mutter. ‘Your grandfather turns on the heat.’ ‘Yes, with those enormous boards, I’m sure she’s well insulated.’ ‘Aigou, yeppun sekhi, poor little thing, poor little  thing,’ she wails, my sarcastic remark completely lost on her. I steer her towards the most brightly coloured boutique, regretting it as soon as I see the trendy clients. A woman with pink hair ushers her to a seat and asks how she can be of help. My grandmother wants a black tint. With a streak of blue. The stylist glances at me for approval. ‘Blue,’ my grandmother says again. Whatever I say she’ll be cross. I bury my head in a magazine. 37

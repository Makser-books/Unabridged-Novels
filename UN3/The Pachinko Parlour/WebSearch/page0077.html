My grandmother sits in the living room surrounded by her Playmobil pieces, watching me work. She doesn’t understand why I’m doing so much tidying and organising, we’re only going for a few days. I explain to her that when you come back from a trip, it’s nice to ?nd your house clean and tidy. ‘Yes, you’re right,’ she exclaims delightedly. ‘Aigou! What would I do without you?’ The bathroom is more of a challenge. I try organising at ?rst, then decide to throw everything away: wipes, dried-up nail polish, cotton wool pads, mouldy creams that have started to resemble cottage cheese.  One evening, my grandmother tries to pull out the Playmobil children’s hair using a pair of scissors. When her attempts at cutting fail, she stabs at them with the points of the blades. ‘You’re bleeding!’ I say as I walk by. She stares at me in surprise. ‘There, on your chin. Didn’t you feel anything?’ ‘No.’ ‘It didn’t hurt?’ She has a cut running all the way down her chin. I clean it, relieved to see it’s only a super?cial wound. My grandmother fusses over the dressing. No. She didn’t feel anything. Nothing at all. She picks up the Playmobil boy, rubs his head sheepishly, throws it back on the pile. I pick up the scissors to see if I can do any better. The plastic is surprisingly tough. ‘See,’ she says, ‘old people aren’t the only ones to be goofy. You never take me seriously, do you?’ Gradually,  she too is overcome with the need to be busy organising. She makes piles of clothes, stu?s them  into suitcases, for herself and for my grandfather. Now I’m  the one pointing out to her that we’re only going for a week: it’s still warm, there’s no point in taking so many clothes. She gets annoyed, says she knows what she’s doing, I don’t know what I’m talking about, it can be very cold in Korea, the weather can change from one day to the next, all of a sudden it can feel like  Siberia. 75

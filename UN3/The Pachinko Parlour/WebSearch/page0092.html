The photographer sees my grandparents, grabs them by the collar and steers them towards the group. ‘They’re not with us, they’re not with us!’ the hikers cry indignantly. My  grandparents have instinctively obeyed the photographer’s instructions. They’re pushed from one member of the group to another before being expelled through a gap between two women in blue baseball caps. ‘Tsk, tsk!’ the women hiss. They scurry away from the group, clutching each other by the shoulder, nervously peering around in search of me. I usher them away and guide them towards an aquarium open to the public for a modest fee. A voice booms from a loudspeaker within the enclosure: ‘Attention all visitors. The seal show is about  to begin!’ We sit down on a bench, eat some doughnuts. A family of deer approaches us. My grandmother feeds them her doughnut, holding it out with the wrapping still attached. They jostle for scraps. I tell her you’re not supposed to feed wild animals. She retorts that the doughnuts have gone soft, the deer are hungry. My grandfather gestures to me to leave her alone. She carries on feeding the deer while we look on. Other deer come right up to her, each one taking its turn. She tickles their heads as they feed, thrilled.  We go to an eel restaurant for dinner. Posters of sumo stars on the walls. The grand championship has just ?nished in Tokyo. The scores are displayed on  a board. An old man sits o? to the side, alone, drinking his soup. A young American couple, just ?nishing their meal, stand up and glance over at us as they leave. I order eel with rice, sweet ?esh that melts in the mouth.  Later, my grandfather has a smoke on our bedroom balcony and I go out to join him. Behind the torii gate,  the last rays of the setting sun glimmer on the water, Hiroshima in shadow in the distance. We watch the ferry bringing back the commuters and the last tourists of the day from the other shore. 90

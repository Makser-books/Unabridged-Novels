I ARRIVE EARLY. The pupils are still in the playground, a  vast, concrete space. Hundreds of children. I never see any children on the streets. Where have they all come from? A group of boys are kicking a ball around, the girls huddled in groups around the benches. A hubbub of voices, the sounds all dampened on this side of the fence, even the thud of the ball as it bounces. It takes me a while to spot Mieko among the children. She’s on her own, drinking royal milk tea, circling the playground. Occasionally, she stops to peer at something, a detail, a rock perhaps or a crack in the wall. Green cap, fringed skirt. The school uniform makes her look thinner. It’s been ten days since we last met up. She’s not expecting me. It occurs to me that she might not recognise me, I should have worn something conspicuous. Such as? I stand close to the gates, in front of the mothers waiting to pick up their children. The bell rings. The children come out two at a time. To my relief Mieko walks over to me. She takes my hand, apparently not at all surprised to see me. ‘So, how’s the new class?’ She pulls a long face. The class isn’t too bad, the atmosphere is a bit odd though. One of her friends killed himself during the summer. The year before, the teacher made him write ‘piggy’ on his homework instead of his name, because he was fat. She holds my hand, chattering as we walk. She doesn’t ask where I’m taking her. We take the train to Ueno Station. When she realises we’ve arrived at the zoo, she does a few skips.  Gingko trees line the walkways. The nuts have ripened early because of the heatwave. Old men are collecting  the harvest, using long-arm grabbers to pick up the nuts that have fallen to the ground, dropping them into baskets they carry on their backs. Looking up, you can see the whale sculpture on the other side of the park, and the Museum of Natural History.  84

Koreans were locked out of the Japanese labour market by virtue of their nationality. So, they invented a game: vertical tray, metal balls, a lever. And cigarettes in exchange for balls. It was Mathieu who explained to me how important pachinko became to the Japanese economy. In 1953,  while Korea was tearing itself apart, its people ?eeing to wherever they could, there were almost four hundred thousand pachinko parlours in Japan. Interest waned during the 1960s when other forms of entertainment began to expand, but even now there are still more than  twenty thousand pachinko parlours in Japan, all run exclusively by Zainichis and their descendants. Mathieu found it surprising that in all those years of exile, my grandparents had never returned to Korea. I remember, when I was little, hearing them say they’d go back one day. Now that they’d reached such a great age, we decided it would be best for us to take them there. It was up to Mathieu to speak to them about it. He said they seemed keen, and we booked our ?ights to  Tokyo.  Korea was unfamiliar territory for both of us and we were planning to make all the other arrangements once we arrived in Tokyo. But as the time approached, Mathieu realised he still had a great deal of work to do to ?nish his thesis. Eventually he decided to pull out of the trip, but he encouraged me to go without him. I couldn’t see myself reading his drafts on the family unit in Japan during the twelfth century – I’d just ?nished working on a second Master’s degree myself. So, I came to Tokyo on my own.  Footsteps on the stairs. I’d left my door open. My grandfather walks past my room, in his pyjamas, waves hello, goes into the bathroom. He’s probably seen the beer. I close the door, turn o? the light, lie down on the ?oor. I start a game of Tetris on my phone. The screen ?ashes in the darkness. Headlights from passing cars light up the room intermittently. I think about the photo  of my parents again, my mother’s message. Me as their little chicken. I picture myself running round in circles, banging into things, falling over. Clucking. I try not to giggle. 25

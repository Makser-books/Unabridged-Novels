IT’S AFTER EIGHT when we arrive back at the house. I’m hungry, so is my grandmother. I suggest we make one of her favourites, noodles perhaps; I’ll cook. No, she says, we have to wait for my grandfather. We could save him some, I suggest. She shakes her head, says it’s sad, eating by yourself. We can have the noodles another time. We’ll  have leftovers this evening, we can reheat the bento boxes. She goes out every day to buy them from the stand on the corner. The empty boxes end up in a heap behind the kitchen door, barely rinsed, still covered in grease. I was horri?ed when I ?rst saw them. I thought back to the hours we used to spend together cooking, making pancakes, soups and stews: eomuk and soegogi-jin,  kimchi and miyeok-guk; and sweet dishes like honey ice cream and hotteok. We’d spend whole afternoons in the kitchen, my grandmother as chef and me as her assistant, her apron knotted around my waist. I was responsible for cleaning up; my grandmother insisted on everything being kept spotless. We bumped into each other constantly in that tiny kitchen. What happened? When did she start buying takeaways? I’d asked her a while back if she was all right. I was worried about her alone in the house all day. I thought she might be bored. ‘I’m ?ne, I’m ?ne,’ she said, gently stroking my back. ‘I take naps.’ And when I asked if she had anything to read, she ?red back scathingly, read what? I let it go. She probably didn’t like me drawing attention to the fact that she didn’t read. I knew she’d held ambitions to study when she was young, Mathieu had told me. She wanted to become a lawyer. But then the Korean War came and they ?ed to Japan. And besides, she was a girl, her parents wouldn’t have allowed her to go to university. Trying not to think about how hungry I am, I put the water on to boil and make a jug of black tea. I add some ice cubes to cool it down, stir in some condensed milk. My grandmother turns on the television in the living room.  I ask if she wants  to  play  Monopoly. She’s thrilled. 41

in a bottle, even though I was much too big by then for a bottle. I’ve broken my record at Tetris. I’ve been stuck on level ?fteen for days.  The days are beginning to draw in. The sky is dark by seven in the evening. I lie on the ?oor and gaze out of the window. Women’s  calves, men’s shoes, heels trodden down by the weight of bodies borne for too long. Salarymen, I can tell from the rigid gait, the uniform. Footsteps of people in a hurry, people dragging their feet. I turn away, try to block them out, but then I see their shadows ?le past on my bedroom wall, distorted, magni?ed in the beam of the streetlight. Sometimes a taxi parks in front of the window, the driver asleep, forehead resting on the steering wheel.  I go to the Family Mart to buy some shampoo, select one with almond milk, my favourite, highly moisturising. At the edge of my vision, I catch a glimpse of my grandfather through the door at the back, inside the Shiny. He walks slowly down the aisle, stopping in front  of every machine to give it a slap on the side, as if he were urging on a beast of burden at the end of a long day’s labour. He goes back to the desk, takes his seat beside the security guard. A player comes up and hands in his collection of balls, walks out holding a stu?ed bear.  I step out of the shop into a downpour. Warm rain falling in a steady stream, washing away the ?lm of grease from every surface. A summer storm, short-lived. I decide to wait it out. I walk up to the sandwich-board woman, stand behind her under the awning. She has a patch of bare skin where her hair is swept to one side in a plait. Water splashes from the canopy. Drops land on the back of her neck. She doesn’t ?inch. The rigid cardboard panels hang down to her ankles, slapping against her body, bu?eted by the wind. I take another step towards her, she smells of rain and laundry soap. I can’t see her face. Her eyelids are cast down beneath the peaked cap, her shoulders hunched. Passers-by take no notice of us. They walk  on.   57

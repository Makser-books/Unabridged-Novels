THE NEXT DAY Henriette messages me. Mieko wants me to take her to Heidi’s Village. She suggests we go on the 20th. We could celebrate my birthday at their place when we get back. They’ll be away until then, spending a week at a seaside resort in Okinawa. The tone of her message is cool. I feel somewhat wounded that neither of them has  mentioned this beach holiday to me. I didn’t say anything to Henriette about it being my  birthday.  Mieko must have  told  her.  I wasn’t planning anything special for the day,  I haven’t even talked to my grandparents about it. As far as they’re concerned, I’ve already turned thirty: in the Korean system, a person’s age is counted from the moment of conception. I reread the message, say yes to the invitation.  With Mieko away, I feel at a loss. I spend too much time in my bedroom, crushed by the heat. I’d like to go out to  a museum, leave the neighbourhood, but my  grandmother worries so much when I go out. I hear her humming a lullaby in Korean, always the same one. It’s nothing like the ones she used to sing to me when I was little, I don’t recognise it. Sometimes I go and wander in the cemetery, listen to the cicadas shrieking. I walk along the quiet street that runs behind the station, sit on the stairs sipping ice-cold amazake, surrounded by cats. This must be the meeting-ground for all the cats in the neighbourhood.  We’re supposed to be leaving in two weeks and my grandfather still hasn’t con?rmed the dates for our trip. I don’t dare ask him again. There’s so much to organise. I start by searching online to get as much information as I can about the trains. We’d need to take the Shinkansen and go up the east side via Kyoto and Hiroshima. Five hours in all, a long journey for two elderly people. We could stop over at the island of Miyajima, where Mieko went with her father. It’s only a few kilometres from Hiroshima.  55

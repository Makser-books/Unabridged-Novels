‘You don’t have to do this,’ he says to me in Japanese. I take a good look at him. His lined forehead, his movements weighed down by an immense fatigue, his breathing laboured. This trip might not work out the way I imagine, he says. I’d like to tell him that I’m not imagining anything, but he continues, punctuating his speech with lengthy pauses. ‘When Korea was divided, we were still nationals of a uni?ed Korea. It was called Choson. At separation, the  Japanese government gave us permission to keep our Korean identity, but we had to choose between North and South. Many people chose the North, because of their family or because they considered the North more in line with our country’s traditions. There was no way of knowing how things would turn out. Your grandmother and I chose the South because we were from Seoul. That was the only reason. We knew nothing about any of the rest of it. Political questions meant nothing to us, the Cold War, Russia, the United States. Koreans who live in Japan have never known North and South Korea. We are all people of Choson. People from a country that no longer exists.’ He pauses. Then adds, ‘We do still have our language.’ I’m sorry I’ve forgotten how to speak it, I say in Japanese. If my mother hadn’t left to go abroad, if I’d been born somewhere other than Switzerland … He stops me. Asks me not to criticise my mother’s choices. He and my grandmother ?ed Korea so she could be born in a country free of war. He has always hated the Shiny. My mother grew up. She wanted to leave and she left. Their only desire was for her to live her life according to her own choices. He looks at me a?ectionately. And now, here I am, he says. I feel myself blushing. We stand there, side by side, for a while. My grandfather lights up another cigarette. Smoke coils around his face, the wind catching the halo as soon as it forms. A few moments later, I say I’m going out again, to stretch my legs a bit.  I walk along the main street. The air feels chill, damp. I pull my jacket tighter. Grilles are drawn across the market stalls.          91

She’s rubbing herself with a facecloth. Smooth skin, arms so skinny you want to grip them ?rmly to stop them falling o?. Angular shoulder blades, pointed, like ?ns. The soap refuses to lather. I think of Henriette’s dry skin, tell myself they need something more moisturising, less harsh. When she closes her eyes to wash her face, I take a good look at her. She hasn’t started to develop yet. Just two nipples, scarcely de?ned, two drops of water on paper. Maybe she won’t need to wear a bra, any more than her mother does. I was only a year older than she is now when my breasts began to develop. When my grandmother noticed, she pressed her thumbs against my chest, as if to push the swelling back inside me, as if it didn’t belong there. My mother had bought me a bra just before the holidays. It was too tight, it cut into my ?esh, I was ashamed of it. I’d hide in the toilets, rubbing my breasts, fretting about the lack of a lock on the door, terri?ed my grandmother would walk in without knocking. The humidity in the bathroom is becoming unbearable. My hair is glued to my temples. I brush it aside, ?ap my skirt around my thighs. Mieko is still soaping herself. I go and wait in the living room. I browse the bookshelves. My eye falls on a French translation of Heidi, between two classic Pléiade volumes. The pages are dotted with notes in Japanese, in green pen, like blades of grass left to dry between the pages. It’s hard to read the text beneath the green. Lines stand out. The eagle looks down on the villagers from the sky: ‘If you would separate and each go your own way and come up here and live on a height as I do, it would be better for you!’ Or the goatherd’s grandmother talking to Heidi: ‘The house is going to pieces, and in the night, when the two others are asleep, I often lie awake in fear and trembling, thinking that the whole place will give way and fall and kill us. And there is not a creature to mend anything for us, for Peter does not understand such work.’ Feeling uncomfortable, I put the book back on the shelf.  A lea?et falls out from the back cover. Heidi’s Village. I open it out.  52

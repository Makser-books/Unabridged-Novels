‘What do you think of her French?’ ‘It’s good.’ I ask her why she hasn’t taken on one of her students as a tutor for Mieko. ‘I teach literature, not language,’ she replies. ‘And in any case, with my students, it would complicate matters, you understand … Having them come here.’ ‘Of course.’ She gives a half-smile. ‘And besides, it was an opportunity to meet you. I’d like to send Mieko to Switzerland later, to a French school.’ She tells me she went to university in Switzerland. She found the experience profoundly enjoyable. ‘Have you read Heidi?’ she asks, scanning the bookshelves with her eyes. I try and remember the story. My mother must have read it to me. I have a vague memory of something rather old-fashioned, about a little girl. ‘I saw the cartoon long before I realised it was actually a book,’  Madame  Ogawa  continues.  ‘I  was  sure  it  was Japanese. Johanna Spyri su?ered from depression – but you must know this, you live in Switzerland.’ I mumble something about not being aware of it. She continues, ‘She couldn’t write the book until after she’d brought up her children. Do you have children?’ ‘No,’ I reply hastily. She gives me a sidelong glance. ‘If you do become a mother, I hope for your sake you don’t have a daughter. She’ll start comparing herself with you eventually. It’s inevitable.’ She picks up a folder full of photos, ?ips through them and takes one out. ‘So much open space …’ she says, waving the picture around as if it might help her remember something. She passes me the photo. I recognise the tram junction, the green-tiled steeple. Paradeplatz in Zürich. It makes me think of Monopoly, my grandmother trying to ?nd the town where we lived on the board.   31

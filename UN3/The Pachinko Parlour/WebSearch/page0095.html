A MONOTONOUS LANDSCAPE of plains that dissolve on the horizon. Houses dotted about, lightweight boxes, scraps of wood, scattered like pawns across a chess board. Forests of trees bending in the wind. Inside the train, the air is still. The Shinkansen heads due south, the sky darkening as we advance.  At the station in Hakata, we take the bus to the port of Fukuoka. The bus carries us through the business district, a residential area, wasteland. Cranes loom in the  mist, containers stacked up behind them. We  arrive at the embarkation quay. A large building, a wedding venue by the looks of it, with a restaurant, a ballroom and a portrait stage. My grandparents say they’ll wait here while I go and check us in. I know it’s merely a delaying tactic, a way to avoid meeting the other passengers. When I come back, I ?nd them in the restaurant. My grandmother has ordered soup, my grandfather a squid salad. I watch them as they eat. My grandmother swallows her food rapidly. My grandfather too, their movements in sync as they nourish their ageing bodies. How alike they are, I re?ect. They’ve lived alongside each other for so long, their features seem to merge into one another.  The boarding area is crowded, the seats in the waiting room all occupied. Koreans everywhere: teenagers; a middle-aged couple; a baseball team, talking loudly, laughing. A boy spits. I can feel my grandmother beside me, the pressure of her hand in mine, her nails pressed to my palm. Damp. I squeeze her hand back. Outside, mist obscures the horizon. The ships in the port are scarcely visible, the containers like splashes of watercolour. ‘My nails have turned black. Look.’ My grandmother waves her hand in my face. I push it away gently. ‘That happens, you scratched the deer.’ 93

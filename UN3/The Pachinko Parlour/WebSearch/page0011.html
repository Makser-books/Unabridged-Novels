‘What’s the point of me being here?’ I ask her. ‘We’ve practised it,’ she says. ‘Practised?’ ‘Yes, because you were coming.’ I think back to the meal we’ve just had, how everything she and her mother did was perfectly synchronised. I watch her working through the exercises for a few moments and then leave her to get on with it. I walk over to the picture window, look down at the station; a central spine, four walkways fanning out like limbs. A lizard lying in wait. Buildings everywhere, overhead wires stretching into the distance, all the way to Mount Fuji, barely visible through the smog. I scan the bookshelves. Rousseau, Chateaubriand. Essays on literature, Swiss Romantics. History books. The  French Revolution. I have the feeling these books don’t contain the history I learnt at school; these volumes tell of another parallel history, one that played out simultaneously on another planet. Around one o’clock, Madame Ogawa comes back up with some royal milk tea and kkwabaegi, Korean doughnuts, from the Family Mart for us. The bodysuit she’s wearing reveals every fold and pleat of her body. After she’s gone back down, I ask Mieko why her mother wears shoes inside the apartment. Japanese people usually take them o? indoors. ‘She says she needs to hear her own footsteps. I’m not supposed to tell anyone.’ We sit side by side munching our snacks. The label on the bottle of tea has a picture of Donald Duck and Daisy in their swimsuits, at the beach. A special summer o?er. Of course, Disneyland Tokyo. I could take Mieko there. I’m not sure she’d like it, maybe amusement parks aren’t her thing. ‘Is there anywhere in particular you’d like me to take you while I’m here?’ She  looks  up  at  the  ceiling,   then  at  me,   goes  to  say  something, hesitates, sits up straight and eventually says she doesn’t really mind, it’s up to me.   9

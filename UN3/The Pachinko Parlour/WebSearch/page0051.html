We wrap ourselves in the towels. They’re too short for me, they stop just below my stomach. ‘The bees are dying,’ says Mieko. ‘So are the trees. There aren’t nearly as many as there used to be in the city. One day they’ll all be dead, and then we’ll all die too.’ I turn to look at her. ‘I’m scared too, you know.’ ‘Of the bees?’ ‘Of the trees dying. Everything. That’s why I like going up high in the mountains, at least it’s normal for there to be no trees there.’ ‘I’ve never seen anything like that,’ says Mieko. ‘Maybe you will some day.’ We huddle together, drink the tea straight from the thermos, passing it back and forth between us. The crescent moon has come into view, lying on its side. It always surprises me in Japan, the way the moon seems to be sleeping, while in Switzerland it stands upright. I tell Mieko. She cranes her neck to look at the moon from a di?erent angle. ‘Are you looking forward to going away?’ I ask. ‘Mum says it’s for my future.’ ‘What about you? What do you think?’ ‘I don’t know really. It’s ages away. When are we going to the pachinko parlour?’ ‘I’m not sure there’ll be enough time,’ I mumble. ‘Later – when the holidays are over!’ I say we’ll have to see. Her chin puckers. I’m afraid she might start to cry, so I say light-heartedly: ‘When I was little, I wanted to be a chlorophyll  splitter.’ She looks at me quizzically. I explain to her what chlorophyll is, that it helps plants to breathe, like our blood helps us. Blood and chlorophyll are actually very similar, four atoms grouped around a central atom. The only di?erence is that chlorophyll has magnesium where haemoglobin has iron. ‘I used to think that if humans could work out how to break chlorophyll down, extract the magnesium and insert it into our bloodstream, we’d be able to produce our own oxygen simply by exposing ourselves to light.   49

Sometimes she freezes, gazes at the suitcases, the bags of rubbish piled up in the hallway. She looks at me, stunned. She starts pulling out the things I’ve put aside  to throw away, says we have to keep them, the papers, creams, cotton wool pads, they’re hers, I have no right to put my paws all over them. She makes ?sts, aims at my back, as if she’s going to hit me. Then she changes her mind and puts everything back where it was. I’m right, she says, it’s time to throw these things out.  My mother hasn’t replied to my request for recordings of my father.  She’s usually so quick to respond. And then one morning, a package from my mother arrives in the post. There’s a letter inside. She’s sorry it took so long, the ?les were too big to upload, they’ve saved them on CDs. ‘What’s that?’ my grandmother asks looking over my shoulder. ‘From Papa. For Mieko.’ I turn on the CD player in the living room. My father has really gone all out. There are four CDs. Everything from requiem masses to ?lm music:  Harry Potter,  The  Addams Family; improvisations, solemn tunes, baroque music, Vivaldi, a Poulenc concerto, Pink Floyd, Rolling Stones, songs: ‘Etoile des Neiges’, ‘Le Vieux Chalet’. My grandmother stands with her eyes closed, listening, arms out in front to balance, like a dancing bear at a fairground. I email my mother: does she realise there’s enough here for several whole days of listening? She says he just carried on and on playing. He wanted to send me all of it. He seemed so happy, she says, so happy. 76

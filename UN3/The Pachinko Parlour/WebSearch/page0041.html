‘Where were you?’ she hisses as I walk up to her. ‘Didn’t she dry your hair?’ ‘You walked o?. I walked out too, I didn’t like that girl. Where were you?’ ‘Guess what!’ I say, holding up the bag of shopping. ‘I bought you some noodles.’ ‘I wanted to get them myself. Which ones did you buy?’ She starts rummaging in the bag. ‘Condensed milk! I didn’t know you liked it too! You never said!’ We  walk back to the station, my grandmother beaming happily. She hangs on to my arm. We stumble along, out of step with each other, her blue streak ?uttering at my shoulder. ‘Did you pay the stylist?’ I ask suddenly. ‘Eh? I’m a thief now, am I?’ Inside the station she tells me her train pass has run out of credit. The machine is out of order, we need to go to the ticket window. She glances up at the station employee, hesitates, hands me the card. ‘You go. I can’t see what I’m doing.’ We exchange looks. I know she’s not telling the truth. She doesn’t want to go the ticket window because she’ll have to speak Japanese. She waits for me in a corner of the concourse, staring at her hands.  On the platform I ask her if she and my grandfather have thought ahead to when they can’t run the pachinko parlour any more. My grandmother brushes away my concern, irritated. She’s worked it out. They’d be able to live for four years on their savings. And in any case, with her old bones, she won’t last long, and have I seen my grandfather, he’ll die before her, and if he dies, she will too. I look at her in shock. She laughs, says she was joking. I insist. Seriously. They might fall, the stairs in their house are steep. Couldn’t they move, delegate the management of the Shiny to the security guard perhaps? She says my grandfather is ?ne, but the security guard  on the other hand is half-dead, plus he wouldn’t be able to a?ord it, he’s Japanese. 39

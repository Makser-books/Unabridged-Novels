My grandfather rubs her back to warm her up. He keeps standing up to check the locks on our suitcases, he’s afraid he’ll forget the code. The stewardess’s voice rings out, in Japanese, boarding will commence soon. The baseball players come back from the food stand with bottles of water, biscuits. My grandmother fusses. Maybe we should do the same, buy water, biscuits. I agree, without thinking. The stewardess is getting ready to open the access to the walkway. We stand motionless, all three of us, in the waiting area, watching her. My grandmother tightens her grip on me. ‘You’re hurting me.’ ‘I want to go home,’ she replies. ‘That’s where we’re going.’ ‘This is the wrong way.’ ‘No, it’s not,’ I say. ‘We’re going to Korea.’ She looks all round her again. ‘I want to go home.’ I don’t know what to do. I make up an excuse about forgetting something in the restaurant and go back outside, onto the quayside.  I call Mathieu. It’s four in the morning there. To my relief, he picks up. He’s back in Geneva, he’d left his phone on in case I needed him. I tell him they’ve changed their minds, they don’t want to go. Mathieu says nothing at ?rst. Then, quite simply, he asks if I want him to come over. ‘No, I’ll come back to Switzerland. I can’t do any more here.’ ‘Yes, you can,’ he says. ‘You should go. You’re the one who needs to go.’ ‘If they don’t go back to Korea now, they never will. I can’t leave them by themselves, not here. What am I supposed to do? I can’t leave them on their own.’ Panic makes me talk faster and faster. Mathieu is unru?ed, his voice calm. ‘They’ve been living there for ?fty years. They’d already been there for twenty years when you were  born.’   94

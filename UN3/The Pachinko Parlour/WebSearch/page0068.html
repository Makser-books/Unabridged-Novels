I try and explain: Mieko and Henriette’s invitation, I’d have said no, if only I’d known. She cuts me o?. I hadn’t told them my plans either. I never tell them anything. She’s even bought a chocolate cake. And as if to emphasise the point, she goes into the kitchen and comes back with a cake, iced and decorated with the number thirty. It’s not my fault, I think to myself, if I don’t tell them anything. If I can’t speak to them in Korean. I can’t help  it if I live in Switzerland and speak French. I studied Japanese for their sakes. Because this is where they live and that’s what people speak here. ‘Tomorrow?’ I mouth. ‘Tomorrow  it won’t be your birthday any more.’ ‘Let’s have it now, then.’ I sit down opposite my grandfather. He’s been staring at the noodles ever since I came in. I ?ll up our bowls. My grandmother is still standing, the cake in her hands. ‘Please sit,’ I say. ‘You don’t love me any more,’ she declares  stubbornly. ‘Aigou …’ my grandfather sighs, his eyes still ?xed on the noodles. ‘Don’t be childish. Come along now.’ She sets the cake down on the ground, faces my grandfather and says: ‘What do you know about anything? You’re oblivious to everything.’ And pointing at me, she adds: ‘Do you even know what she does all day long?’ My grandfather ?inches, cowering almost. She carries on. ‘She says she’s come here for our sakes, but she’s never here. She’s out all the time.’ ‘That’s not true,’ I say, defending myself, ‘I’ve only seen Mieko four times.’ It is strange though, I feel I’ve known this child for a long time, that somehow I know her really well. ‘And what’s more,’ I add, ‘she said she wanted to meet you. I’d have liked to bring her back here with me.’ ‘So why didn’t you?’ my grandmother asks, suddenly very calm.   66

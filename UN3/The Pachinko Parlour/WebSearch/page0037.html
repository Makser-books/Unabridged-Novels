LEANING AGAINST the wall of the carriage, I watch the other passengers’ re?ections in the window opposite. A teenager hunched over his phone, headphones clamped to his ears. Three young women in heels. One of them is putting on her make-up, using her friend’s glasses as a mirror. Another pulls on a grey tutu over her suit, peeling o? the suit afterwards. Some of the men watch. It’s Saturday evening, I’d forgotten. Further down, another young woman. Round face, soft arms. Her trousers don’t ?t, they’re too long for her. I adjust my stance and realise I’ve made myself conspicuous. I straighten up, act like I’m playing Tetris to hide my embarrassment. I think about what Madame Ogawa – Henriette – said. About pachinko and the Shiny.  The sequins. The glitter ball. My mother always did her best to keep me away from it during our visits. We used to come for two or three weeks a year, it was the only time I spent with grandparents. I remember the players smelling of grilled meat, cigarettes. How cold it was in winter when the doors swung open. The piped music. The silent players, deep in concentration, sweating. The machines  constantly spitting out balls, absorbing the occasional blow. I felt almost a?ectionate towards those machines, a kind of pity tinged with fear. As soon as they were fed, their contents would be regurgitated, undigested. My grandfather still had hair then, always carefully combed with the same wax that sumo wrestlers use. He let me arrange the prizes in the display, making sure my mother didn’t know about it. Every evening, he’d go  round checking all the machines, taking note of any in need of repair, making sure nothing could go wrong. There was one incident. A player fed a coin into his machine’s rumbling belly.  Nothing happened. No balls appeared. He put in another coin. The machine spat it out, ‘Error’ ?ashed up on the screen. He stared. Thescreen blinked. Once. Twice. Went dead. He called for my grandfather, who o?ered him another machine to play while he repaired the ?rst one.    35

LATER  IN THE EVENING, I go online, do some searching. September is the best time of year to visit Korea. Ferries go from Fukuoka in southern Japan to Busan. Night crossings are less expensive but they’re slow. There are faster ones that only take three hours. We’ll book one of those. And then what? Should we stop in Busan for the night to break the journey? Or would it be better to do it all in one day? My grandparents will be tired, but I want to make the most of the time we have there. I google ‘port of Busan’ and images of bridges pop up. It seems there are several in the bay. The largest is shown from various angles. Ships sail beneath it. An enormous bridge. The ?rst thing you see when you arrive from Japan by sea. It’s visible from a long way o?, lit up at night like a bow and arrow aimed at the moon.  Mathieu sends me his news. He’s making progress but he has a large group of hikers there, he’s very busy. There was a storm last night, with high winds. A couple has arrived with a nine-month-old baby. Seriously. A baby! I type a quick answer, not mentioning the baby or Mieko.  There’s a message from my mother about my father’s latest concert. I still haven’t responded to the recording she sent me ?ve days ago. She’s probably worried about me but she’s afraid to say it. She asks what my grandparents say about her.  Nothing. They don’t talk about you. I read over what I’ve written. Erase it. Everything’s ?ne. They send their love. I close my laptop and roll over onto the ?oor. Cars throw spray onto the pavement. A child jumps in puddles, his mother pulling him along by the hand, he looks like he’s ?ying. It’s almost twenty years since we last went anywhere together.  44

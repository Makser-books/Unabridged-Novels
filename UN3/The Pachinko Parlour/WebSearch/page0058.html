I mention it to my grandparents.  It’s  up  to  me,  they  say,   they’re happy to go along with whatever I decide. They’re not really listening, they’re too busy staring at the television.  Once in a while, I play Monopoly with my grandmother. We’re just starting our game one day when she nods towards my bedroom and says, out of the blue: ‘Okay, okay, go, go.’ I feign protest, carry on playing. After a while, I stand up and go downstairs, feeling sad but relieved.  I can hear them talking upstairs; snippets of conversation ?oat down to me through the ceiling. My grandfather, holding forth about the Shiny. More and more women are playing these days but they don’t really feel welcome. They’re mostly non-smokers. Some parlours have separate sections for smokers nowadays. Some of them target women players, provide childcare. Perhaps it was time to make some changes at the Shiny.  I tense up when I hear this. They never mention Korea. I write to Mathieu: the time for our trip is fast approaching, I feel as if I’m dragging them there. Nothing seems to be happening here. I’m starting to think we’ll never get there. He tells me to see it from their perspective, they must be feeling anxious, everything will have changed, it’s been such a long time since they  left  their  home.  Do  I  need  any  help?  He  can buy the tickets, do some of the translating for me. No, it’s all ?ne, I reply,  feeling somewhat piqued. I can take care of it. Everything is ?ne. On his side, the thesis is coming together. He can see the end in sight. He wishes me a happy birthday, he won’t be able to write to me on the day but he’ll make it up to me when I get back, promise.  I have a craving for marzipan. Fatty, comforting. My mother used to give it to me to drink, watered down. She fed it to me  56

I try not to touch any surfaces. The seat belt is loose on Mieko, even when it’s pulled tight. I can’t see the expression on her face. When we get to the pirates’ island, I make a show of laughing at Captain Hook, oohing and aahing exaggeratedly until suddenly we pick up speed and I’m ?ung against Mieko. She turns and gives me a slightly condescending smile. For the rest of the ride, I cling to the edge of the seat.  When we emerge it’s raining even harder. We wait it out in the souvenir shop. A father with his two sons. He tells them they can each choose a soft toy. Australian accent. He reminds me of Mathieu, with that sweater, the orange anorak. Mathieu has started talking about children lately. There don’t seem to be many here. It’s mostly young couples. The man smiles at me, he’s seen me looking at him. He must think I’m a parent too. I look away. Mieko is examining the Minnie Mouse ears. ‘Would you like a pair of ears?’ I ask. She shakes her head. Does she want a drink? No. I adjust my poncho. I’m thirsty. I need something to drink. I tell her to wait for me here.  I cross the road, make for a café inside Ali Baba’s Cavern. Minnie Mouse is there too, on a break. She’s removed the head of her costume, the big hands. I sip my drink slowly, relieved to be away from Mieko. I want her to enjoy herself. Have some fun. I feel like tugging at her ear, pinching her cheek and pleading directly into her ear: please, Mieko, please have fun. The Australian has followed me. He’s seated the boys at a table near mine and gone to give their order.  A waitress approaches him, hands him a menu in English, passes one to the French couple too, and to those young Chinese girls. I wasn’t o?ered one, people think I’m Japanese. But I’ve never felt more foreign than I have this summer, with this child at my side. The father comes back with a tray of cinnamon rolls. His children fall on them hungrily. I scurry away to rejoin Mieko.  19

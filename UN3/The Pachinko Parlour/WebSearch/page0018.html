THREE DAYS have gone by. I’ve changed my mind about taking Mieko to Disneyland. All children love places like that. I’d have gone there myself with my grandmother when I was Mieko’s age, but my mother was against it. She didn’t consider it appropriate.  I head towards Nippori  station. It’s rained in the night, a monsoon downpour, although Japan’s monsoon season is supposed to be over. The temperature has stalled, several degrees above the average for this time of year. The sandwich-board woman smells of wet clothes. Her boards are limp and waterlogged. She’s stepped back under the awning, out of the rain, but still visible from  the sidewalk. Her hair is matted. She ?xes her gaze straight ahead, the microphone in her hand. It’s supposed to be attached to her cap. The elastic must have gone. I make a mental note to mention it to my grandfather. It’s not quite time for my train. I go into the Family Mart, stop in front of the packaged pastries, try to get a clearer image of the contents obscured by the logos all over the packaging. I can see someone squinting at the yoghurts in the chilled section. Pink sweater. Yuki. I ran into him here this morning too. He comes in by the back entrance, through the glass door that connects with the Shiny. Most players at this time of day are women; they come while their children are at school, or on summer programmes, and their husbands are at work. The older people, retirees, come mostly in the afternoon. Early in the evening, the machines are taken over by salarymen and sumo wrestlers. Yuki selects a choco-mint doughnut and goes back to the Shiny. The door slides open; a blast of loud music, rapid-?re salvos of pachinko balls. People say the name pachinko comes from the noise the balls make in the machine, pinging against the glass, swooshing through the plastic tubes, clanking against the bumpers, the shriek of metal, the ?nal clang as they fall into the tray.  16

She brings me a glass of water from the drinking fountain. ‘You need ?uids in this heat. You’ll get heatstroke. Are you from here?’ she asks as she wipes her hands. I tell her I’m Korean. ‘Oh,’ she says, smiling. ‘You speak very good Japanese.’ Her teeth look discoloured, like shrivelled olives, her mouth must be dry. ‘What I meant was, are you new here? Are you on the sta??’ ‘No, I live in Switzerland.’ She blinks. ‘Oh well, in that case,’ she says, smiling again, relaxed, ‘I’m so sorry, but you can’t stay here. It says so there, on the door.’ ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t see.’ As I’m leaving, she adds, with concern in her voice, ‘You really don’t look too well. You should go home.’  Mieko is sitting in front of the church, waiting for me. In her lap, an empty sandwich wrapper and an unopened can of Pocari Sweat. She hands it to me and I open it and take a swig. Warm, slightly salty. I set it down between us. Mieko points to it timidly, ‘Dare I?’ she asks me in French. I hand it to her immediately, ashamed not to have realised that she was waiting for me to drink ?rst. I hadn’t stopped to think about whether she was hungry or thirsty. I ought to explain to her that she’s used the wrong verb to ask me. It’s too late now.  Secretly,  I ?nd it reassuring that she makes mistakes. It reminds me that she is only a child.  In the bus on the way back, Mieko holds my hand. Suddenly, she pulls away from me and sticks her mouth against the window, making loud sucking sounds. ‘Hey! What are you doing?’ She pulls her lips away for a moment. ‘Cleaner ?sh.’ She takes a deep breath, ready to start again. I put my hand on her shoulder to restrain her. 63

I ?nd her stroking a Bambi ?gurine. ‘Do you like Bambi?’ I ask hopefully. She nods. ‘Would you like me to buy it for you?’ ‘No, that’s okay.’ ‘I’ll give it to you as a gift. I’d like to.’ ‘But I don’t want it. His mother’s dead and his father goes away somewhere at the end, and we don’t know where he’s gone.’ ‘That’s because he’s old. He goes away to die.’ ‘I know that,’ she says scathingly. Snippets of the story come back to me. It wasn’t my favourite Disney tale, I found it irritating, the timid little fawn afraid of his own shadow. ‘I don’t want it!’ she says again as I head towards the cash desk with the ?gurine. ‘I’m buying it for my grandmother.’ She stares at me in disbelief. I ?nish paying and stu? the ?gurine into the bottom my bag, holding it close under my arm to keep it out of the rain. Mieko hasn’t taken her eyes o? me. ‘It’s just to remind her of when I was little,’ I say, thinking of the evenings my grandmother and I used to spend together watching the videos I brought with me from Switzerland – The Lion King,  The Little Mermaid,  Sleeping Beauty –  it was something we both enjoyed. ‘All children play with their grandmothers …’ ‘I didn’t,’ she mutters, eyes cast down. I try and make amends. I wasn’t exactly playing with my grandmother, I say, it was more a way of being together, and besides, I didn’t see her very often, only during the holidays, and my grandfather was always working at the pachinko parlour, from morning till night. ‘The pachinko parlour,’ Mieko says, interrupting me. ‘That’s where I’d like to go.’ I laugh. Does she even know what a pachinko parlour is? She rolls her eyes. Obviously, everyone knows about pachinko parlours, they’re everywhere. She’s never been inside one. That’s what she wants to do with me.  20

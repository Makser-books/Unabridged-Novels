‘You look at it like you think it’s weird.’ I try and deny it but she says she hates it too, and I immediately regret lying to her. ‘Can you swim?’ I ask. She says she wishes she’d learnt, but her mother thinks the water in swimming pools isn’t clean, it’s full of bacteria, it’s not good for your digestion. I say she’s not missing much, I’ve never really liked swimming. ‘You don’t like pachinko too,’ she says. ‘You don’t like anything.’ ‘Pachinko either. We say “either”. And that’s not what I said. It’s not true that I don’t like anything.’ ‘Why aren’t we going there?’ ‘We will,’ I say. ‘When?’ ‘Soon.’ ‘Promise?’ ‘I promise,’ I say unconvincingly. I set today’s lesson out on the desk. This time I’ve prepared the exercises. Mieko says she’s hungry and I produce the plums and kkwabaegi I bought at the Family Mart from my bag. ‘Doughnuts!’ she exclaims. ‘My favourite!’ She breaks open a plum and plants it on a doughnut. It looks like a stick ?gure sitting cross-legged. ‘Me, with fair hair,’ she says waving it about next to her face. ‘Stop it, you look like my grandmother.’ She bursts out laughing, says she can’t wait to meet her. ‘I’m not sure we’ll be able to do that,’ I say cautiously. ‘Why? When we go to the pachinko parlour …’ ‘She’s never there. It’s only my grandfather. She stays at home. Whenever she goes out, she gets lost.’ ‘Why? Doesn’t she know her way around?’ ‘She’s old. And no, Tokyo isn’t really her home.’ Mieko purses her lips, a sign that she’s processing  this. My grandmother wouldn’t like the idea of this meeting at all, I think to myself. She’d have to speak Japanese.  27

She wants an omelette. The fridge is full of eggs, her mother has stocked up: quails’ eggs, hens’ eggs, scrambled eggs, square omelettes from Family Mart, egg salads. There’s even a vacuum-packed fried egg, its yolk bulbous beneath the transparent packaging. I take out one of the omelettes. Mieko shakes her head, she wants to make it from scratch. ‘Are you sure?’ Making an omelette  wasn’t included in Henriette’s instructions, I say. ‘Yes, it was,’ she says, cracking an egg on the side of the pan. I watch nervously. Egg white runs down along the shell and over her ?ngers, like drool from a sleeper’s lips. I haven’t handled raw eggs since I came upon one with an embryo. I ?ddle with the ready-made omelette, feeling its texture through the packaging. Like a sponge. I give it a squeeze and something yellowish oozes from it. I let go and it’s sucked back in. Mieko lights the burner, she’s beaten at least ten eggs. Mum says I have to eat food from abroad so I can get used to it before I leave. Apparently I’ll be ready to go when all my cells have regenerated with new kinds of food.’ I ask her if she knows why her mother wants me to call her Henriette, I’m sure it’s not her real name. She shrugs. ‘Probably because of Heidi.’ ‘Heidi?’ ‘It starts with the same letter.’ The eggs start to sputter in the pan, exploding limply, shooting specks of yellow in every direction. Mieko presses her ?nger to one, puts it in her mouth: ‘Mmmm, that’s good, nice and crisp.’ After we’ve eaten, she asks me to help her in the shower. She undresses, throws her clothes in a ball into the basin. The bathroom is too small for two people. I sit on the toilet and stare discreetly at the ?oor. I haven’t seen a female child’s body since I grew up myself. The heat is intense, but Mieko still turns the hot water on full. Steam envelops us. I look over at her.  51

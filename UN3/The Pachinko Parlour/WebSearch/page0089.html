IN THE TRAIN on the way back, we stand, amid the crush of rush-hour commuters, our bags wedged between our calves. Mieko is too short to hold the ceiling straps. I hang on to her by her jacket. ‘I thought of something,’ she says after a few minutes. ‘We ought to shed our skins, like animals. The older we got, the more transparent our skin would become. In the end you’d be able to see all our insides through it. Veins, bones, feelings, everything. Our skin would be a mirror too, people would be able to see themselves in it. Eventually we’d become completely transparent, and when that happened, we’d give our last breath to our child.’ ‘Our child?’ ‘Yes. The one that goes on living after.’ ‘After us?’ I say, correcting her. ‘Is that what you mean?’ She doesn’t respond. ‘What if you don’t have any children? Or if you don’t want to have any?’ She thinks for a while. ‘You still have to die,’ she says.  We sway against each other as the train swings from side to side. Neither of us speaks for the next three stops. ‘Would it be painful?’ I ask. ‘No. We’d just get lighter and lighter, that’s all.’  At Shinagawa station I walk as far as the exit with her. I give her the CDs and the kkwabaegi by the main entrance.  The straps of her backpack are ?apping about loosely. She stands still while I tighten them for her. I tap her lightly on the shoulder when I’ve ?nished. ‘We haven’t spoken much French …’ ‘No.’ ‘You can tell your mother if you want.’ ‘Tell her what?’ 87

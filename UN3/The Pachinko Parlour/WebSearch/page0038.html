But the player started shouting about this being his machine,  it was the only one he ever played.  He wrapped his   arms round it, as if trying to breathe life into it. My grandfather tried to reason with him, but the man still clung to the pachinko machine, like a tick to its host. When my grandfather threatened to call the police, the man began to cry. I was scared and hid by the desk, behind the crates of ?zzy drinks. He ended up punching the screen, accusing my grandfather of being a crook and screaming that the machine had been tampered with. The security guard  was in on it too, he shouted, they were dogs, every one of them. He left before he had a chance to see the machine spitting out an endless stream of balls. They spurted out of every hole, rolling unchecked along the ground, rebounding against the other machines, against players’ feet, until ?nally they rolled to a stop against the wall. My grandfather picked them up one by one and put them back into the machine, moving with his customary lack of haste. The other players paid no attention. Once he’d ?nished he came to ?nd me in my hiding place. Sensing my confusion, he looked me in the eyes and said no one was to blame. Machines sometimes went wrong. Back then, they were manually operated. Now, they’re all computerised. I get back to Nippori at seven o’clock in the evening. The sky is charcoal grey. Crows circle above the electric wires. Outside the Chinese restaurant, people are queuing. ‘Shiny, Shiny, day and night, shiny, Shiny, shining bright.’ I notice the microphone attached to the sandwich- board woman’s baseball cap. Her shoes. White trainers, laced up like mine, with double bows. She turns her head slightly towards me. I pretend to be studying the machines. Yuki is on one near the window. I can see the guard behind the counter, facing the CCTV monitors, the top of my grandfather’s head as he bends to look at something. I’d go in and say hello, see what’s new in the displays, the prizes he’s o?ering, but my mind is on that conversation with Henriette. I can’t stop thinking about Mieko. I go into the Family Mart instead and buy a doughnut. 36

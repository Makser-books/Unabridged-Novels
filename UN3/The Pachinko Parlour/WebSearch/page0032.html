I give her a stern look. She sets to work, and I sit on the bed in her spot. I shouldn’t have lost my temper like that. She’s too young to understand, it has nothing to do with her. We agree to give up on manuals and exercises and just chat instead, in French or in Japanese, whatever we feel like. ‘You  won’t tell your mother?’ ‘Yes, I won’t tell.’  We spend the rest of the afternoon playing Tetris on my phone. I can’t concentrate. I keep thinking of the photo my mother sent me. It worries me. She looks older, she’s ageing. I’ve never noticed it before. ‘We’ll go and see some deer if you like,’ I say to Mieko. ‘Real ones.’ ‘Where?’ ‘At  the  zoo.  In  Ueno  Park.  It’s  near  where  my grandparents live.’ Her face lights up. ‘Okay.’  When Madame Ogawa comes home, Mieko chats to her about her day. I feel out of place and shut myself in the bathroom. Dust has been left to accumulate. No beauty products. Only soap, and a shampoo base. I wash my hands. I feel tainted. All that rain has stirred up the pollutants, the air is heavy with them. Toxins seep into my body through every pore, leak out in my sweat. The earth expelling poison through the humans it wears on its surface like a coat of hairs.  I go back out and ?nd Madame Ogawa sitting by herself on the sofa. She pats the seat beside her, inviting me to join her. She asks me how the visit to Disneyland went. I embellish things a little, make it sound like Mieko and I get on better than we do. ‘She’s a lonely child,’ she says eventually. ‘I’m glad she likes you.’ I smile, out of politeness.  30

While her hair is being shampooed she starts to talk. The stylist nods. My grandmother is getting excited. She’s talking about me, boasting of my linguistic prowess, counting o? languages on her ?ngers. She says I speak French, German, English, Italian. She’s exaggerating, I cringe. She mentions Switzerland, ‘seuwisseu, seuwisseu’. The girl pretends to be impressed. When my grandmother starts boasting about how good my Korean is, I can’t take any more. I stand up. ‘Are you leaving me?’ she asks, worried. I mumble something about coming back soon. Outside, I close my eyes, turn my face to the sun. Dots of light form beneath my lids. I stand there like that for a moment, dazzled.  Not  so  long  ago  my  grandmother  was  still  playing  the face game with me. She’d stick plasters all over my face and then ask me to say the words: ipp, mouth; noun, eye; theok,  chin;  ipsul,  lips;  kho,  nose.  With  each  correct answer she would delicately peel o? some of the plasters. ‘That’s how you discover a face, your little round face, the most beautiful face in the world, my granddaughter, my little girl, my cupcake, my baby, my big sweetie-pie with the little round face.’ She’d laugh and stroke my face. But one evening, when I’d stumbled over the vocabulary several times, she ripped all the plasters o? at once, pulling so roughly I felt my skin burning, saying that if I forgot these words, I’d be stuck like that forever, with plaster all over my face, like a mummy.  I go to the supermarket and buy ?sh stock, kimchi, the noodles she wanted and a tube of sweetened condensed milk. I’ve noticed that she likes it, she licks a tube of it before she goes to bed, after she’s brushed her teeth.  On my way back to the hairdresser’s I see her on the street. She’s looking around frantically, trying to ?nd me. Her hair is still damp. 38

I must have been seven or eight at the time. The farmer’s wife made little cows just like these. At the end of the visit we were all given some strong-smelling cheese. Most of my classmates threw it away, especially the girls, who put on extravagant displays of disgust for the bene?t of  the boys. I hid mine in my bag. I wanted to take it home for my mother. In the bus, the smell started to waft out. Everyone turned in my direction and someone said I stank and told me to go and sit somewhere else. I moved to the back of the bus, hugging my bag close in an e?ort to contain the smell. By the time I reached home, fat had seeped out onto my homework notebook. It smelt of cheese for the rest of the year. But my gift was a success. My mother loved it.  It seems a long time since Mieko went o? by herself. I walk back through the park and catch sight of her squatting on her heels beside the pond. The horizon shimmers in the heat. I don’t want to disturb her. I wander among the ?ower beds, keep walking to where the vegetation is denser, not so well maintained, until I come to a greenhouse, as big as the grandfather’s chalet, in the shadow of a windmill. On the metal door is an inscription in Japanese lettering, the characters interwoven with kittens: ‘Clara’s Sanatorium’. I go inside, amused.  The air feels cooler in the greenhouse. Gardening tools, a collection of miniature olive trees growing in containers. Water burbles from an imitation marble fountain. I taste olive oil on my tongue, full and round, the taste of summer holidays. A plastic duck paddles on the spot, its beak caught in the spigot. A caterpillar crawls along the edge. Feeling suddenly dizzy, I lean against the fountain, almost crushing the caterpillar. ‘Are you all right?’ A woman is watching me from the back of the greenhouse, a tray of olives in one hand, a pair of secateurs in the other. Immaculate uniform, in the park’s colours: red and white, a curious hybrid of the Swiss and Japanese ?ags.   62

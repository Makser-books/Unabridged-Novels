BY THE TIME we ?nish our lesson, it’s already getting dark. Henriette has asked me to stay on past the usual time, she has a meeting. Mieko declares that she has something to show me. She wants to take me up to the roof. We  climb the emergency staircase and step out onto a platform. Air vents cling to its surface like leeches. Smoke billows up from below. Looking down, all you can see are low-rise buildings, no higher than the lamp-posts, lights coming on in the windows. Signposts. No cars. Everything seems to ?oat, like jelly?sh in the sky. Mieko points at the building across the way. ‘That’s where the bee came from. They’re Tokyo bees. They make cherry blossom honey because cherry blossoms are the only ?owers in the city.’ It takes me a while to make out the hives. Little houses lined up by the dozen on the roof. ‘I’m cold, I’m going to get something warm,’ Mieko says, heading back inside. I walk over to the edge. Cawing of crows. Ambulance sirens. Mu?ed sounds. A spider spins its web on the railing; it looks as big as the rooftop baseball pitches in the distance, their safety nets. A player, his hand frozen in mid-air, waiting to catch a ball. He hurls his body forward in slow motion, surely it will take him years to return to his original position. I stand watching this lone player for a moment, mirroring his gestures, their in?nite slowness, wondering if he really is playing or if it’s a trick of perception, if time has stalled and slowed down all movement. ‘Onni?’ Mieko is staring at me, holding a thermos and two towels. I become conscious of the way I’m standing: on one foot, one leg raised with bent knee, one hand in the air. I adjust my stance, show too much enthusiasm for the thermos, say it’s a sure sign that summer is ending. ‘It’s cold,’ she laughs. ‘It’s royal milk tea.’   48

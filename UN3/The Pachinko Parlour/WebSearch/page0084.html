‘A camp,’ she says again. ‘A week of special activities. Intensive. So the children can all catch up.’ ‘I didn’t know.’ ‘No reason why you should. You’re her teacher, not her mother.’ She stares at me for a moment. Then she steps onto the ramp and goes up the stairs. I follow her up. The bodysuit she’s wearing makes her muscles stand out. She holds herself upright – her carriage seems unnaturally sti? for someone who practises yoga. I wonder if she realises how anxious Mieko feels about school. I feel powerless, frustrated. When we get to the top of the stairs, she doesn’t invite me to go through into the living room. She says she doesn’t have anything she can o?er me to eat. ‘I could make a quick trip to the convenience store,’ she says. ‘If you like.’ ‘No need,’ I reply.  Hovering between us, the image of Henriette, eating crab. ‘The building work’s started, I see,’ I say,  nodding  towards the tarpaulin across the lift. ‘Yes?’ she says. ‘Was there something else?’ I fumble around in my bag for the CDs. ‘They’re for Mieko,’ I say, handing them to Henriette. ‘My father, playing the organ.’ ‘Does Mieko like organ music?’ ‘I don’t know. But I’d promised her. I wanted to give them to her before I leave for Korea tomorrow.’ ‘With your grandparents?’ ‘Yes. We’re going by boat.’ I describe our itinerary. ‘You should have asked me for advice,’ she says. ‘I know the crossing to Fukuoka by heart. I did it dozens of times with my husband. Before Mieko was born.’ She gives me a kindly look. Almost maternal. Asks me if I’ve enjoyed my holidays. ‘I wish I’d been able to ?t more in.’ ‘I made you work too much.’  82

THE  HEATWAVE  INTENSIFIES.  On the morning of my birthday, the weather presenter issues a warning, urging the populace, especially the elderly, to avoid going out, to stay inside in the cool and drink plenty of ?uids. ‘Did you hear that?’ I call out to my grandmother as I tie my shoelaces. I’ve prepared bottles of water for her to drink during the day. I can hear her moving about upstairs. She seems strangely agitated. I sensed it last night. She keeps going in and out of the kitchen, walking  round in circles. Since breakfast this morning, I’ve had the feeling she’s waiting for me to leave. ‘Okay, okay, go, go!’ she shouts back at me from the living room.  I meet Mieko in Shinagawa. We take the Yamanote line to Shinjuku together, where the trains for the Yamanashi Prefecture leave from. ‘How was it with your mum? Everything all right?’ She nods, staring out of the window. She’s hardly said a word all morning. When I ?nally ask her why she’s so quiet she says it’s because the holidays are almost over.  We  leave behind the outskirts of Tokyo,  emerging  into countryside. Mossy forests. Small valleys. One hour later, at the end of the Chuo line, we take a bus, together with a handful of old men, all wearing bandanas. The bus jolts along a gravel road for about ten kilometres, dropping us beside a high wall that marks the perimeter of Heidi’s Village.  For some reason, entry into the park is free of charge today. There’s no one at the reception desk. On the other side of the wall, we emerge onto a square surrounded by medieval façades that are vaguely Alsatian in style. A church, a town hall, a restaurant, a museum dedicated to the animated ?lm of Heidi,  and  a  tower  boasting  a  panoramic  view.    59

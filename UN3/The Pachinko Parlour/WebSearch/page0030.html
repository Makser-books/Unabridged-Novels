‘Did she like your Bambi gift?’ Mieko asks. I mumble yes, ask her if she has any coloured felt-tips, I can’t ?nd any in her desk drawers. ‘You know,’ she says, ‘I saw some fawns once. In Miyajima. There are loads of them wandering about, but people feed them and they’re getting a bit stupid and starting to die. They’re forgetting how to ?nd food for themselves. Or else they get diabetes.’ Miyajima. The island famous for its shrine at the water’s edge, with the red gates that seem to ?oat on the water at high tide. Mathieu had wanted to go there, but we ended up just staying at my grandparents’ place. ‘I went there by train with my daddy. We were right up front with the driver. My dad was checking to see everything was working properly – he designed the train. I never fed the deer. But there was still one that followed me. Everywhere I went, even in the morning outside the hotel, it’d been waiting for me all night.’ I tease her, was it really the same one? With so many  of them, how could she be sure? She looks taken aback, her eyes well up. ‘I was only joking,’ I say quickly. She props herself up on her elbows. ‘One day I’ll have a real bedroom. But we can’t leave while Daddy’s still not here.’ ‘Where is he?’ ‘Don’t you know? He got on a train one day and he’s never come back.’ I turn and look at her. She’s ?ung herself back down onto the mattress. I think back to what I said to her at Disneyland, about Bambi, his father going away to die. ‘I’m so sorry, Mieko. I had no idea.’ She says it doesn’t matter, it happened a long time ago. And then adds: ‘But if we’re not here when he comes back, how would he ever ?nd us?’ She  sighs,  a  long  exhale  that  turns  into  a  hissing sound. I feel awkward and suggest we do some work.  28

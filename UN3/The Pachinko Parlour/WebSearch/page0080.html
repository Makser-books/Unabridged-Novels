I arrive at the Shiny. My grandfather has unplugged the strings of lights, turned o? the neon lighting, the spotlights. With the shopfront darkened like this, I realise how badly lit this end of the street is, with its two meagre streetlights either side of the taxi rank. The main source of light here was the Shiny, attracting all the insects at night. I bring my face close to the window. With no one to play them, the machines seem pathetic. A single bulb glimmers weakly near the desk, the watchman just discernible in its dim glow. Pachinko balls. For Mieko. I could ask him to give me some, I won’t get another chance. Rain starts falling, ?ne and cold. Autumn rain, with a tang of rust. I realise the summer is over.  I go into McDonald’s, order a co?ee and sit down by the window. Why so much neon lighting, I wonder, squinting to block out the glare. The co?ee has an odd, acidic taste. Rain lashes against the window. An old man comes in carrying a cup on a tray, his mouth twitching. He looks around for somewhere to sit. All the seats are taken. He goes up to the smoking ?oor. Without quite knowing why, I get up from my seat and follow him upstairs. He’s found somewhere to sit at the communal table, a sleeping man next to him on one side, a boy studying on the other. I’d like to tell him he can have my seat but I’d feel stupid, I don’t know him. I go back downstairs. My seat has been taken by a familiar-looking ?gure. Hair in braids, white trainers, tied in a double knot. I’ve never seen her without her sandwich boards before.  She’s shapelier than I imagined. She’s wearing a short- sleeved top. Eating a burger and fries. ‘Excuse me.’ I lean down in front of her to pick up my tray. She moves back a fraction, still chewing. She shivers, goosebumps rising in little mounds on her smooth, hairless arms, like worms in wet sand.  I stand there, wondering what to say, until it dawns on me that she’s utterly unaware of my existence. She walks over to the bin to throw away the remains of her burger before going back 78

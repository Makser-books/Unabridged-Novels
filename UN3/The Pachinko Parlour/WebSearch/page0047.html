My mother, my grandmother and me. In the Museum of Nature and Science in Ueno, the hall devoted to evolution. Images projected onto a circular screen, silhouette ?gures ?ling past, men, women and children. On horseback, then in carriages, in cars and ?nally in a spaceship. They hold hands as they move on, leaping forwards to each new era. The soundtrack reminds me of a song, from the ?lm Noddy in Toyland – four beats to a bar, jaunty. My mother whispers something to my grandmother, they’re arguing in Korean, I don’t know what about, I hear my mother say the word ‘slave’ again and again. I wait. I watch the ?lm several times. I want to move on to another room. The next one is full of animals. I ask my mother if I can go and look. She says no, it’s time to go home. My grandmother says  pointedly that just for once she could let me do as I like, I only want to see a few animals. My mother looks daggers at her. ‘Oh, all right,’ she says, giving me a push, ‘go on then, go on!’ And I go running in to see the exhibition of stu?ed animals. My footsteps ring out beneath the vaulted stone ceiling. Bears, tigers, deer, pandas, aboard Noah’s ark. Clumps of dried fur fallen on the ground. It’s late afternoon. The sky clouds over, daylight fades, the lights come on. I stand in front of the lion and stare into its gaping jaws. The tongue coated in dust. Unseeing eyes. On the walls, huge panels displaying insects, pinned through the belly or the back, legs splayed. I turn round and realise I’m all alone, my mother and grandmother are still in the other room. I run back, bury my face in my mother’s skirt, smothering my tears. ‘What else did you expect?’ she says, speaking in French. ‘They’re nothing but stu?ed animals.’ She turns to face my grandmother and adds: ‘Old carcasses, with glass beads for eyes.’  Back at the house, my grandmother asked me what my mother had said. ‘Nothing,’ I lied.  45

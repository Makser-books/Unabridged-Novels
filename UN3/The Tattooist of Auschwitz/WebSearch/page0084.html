Lale gathers his team and tells them what a great job they’ve done. The crowd has begun to disperse. He looks around to find Gita, who hasn’t moved from her spot. He jogs over to her and takes her by the hand. They move through the other prisoners towards the administration block. As Gita drops to the ground behind the building, Lale looks around for prying eyes. Satisfied, he sits beside her. He watches Gita as she runs her fingers through the grass, examining it intently.‘What are you doing?’‘Looking for four-leaf clover. You’d be surprised by how many there are here.’Lale smiles, charmed. ‘You’re kidding.’‘No, I’ve found several. Ivana finds them all the time. You look shocked.’‘I am. You’re the girl who doesn’t believe she’ll get out of here, yet you are looking for good luck charms!’‘They’re not for me. It’s true I don’t believe in such things.’ ‘For who then?’‘Do you know how superstitious the SS are? If we find a four-leaf clover we treasure it. It’s like currency for us.’‘I don’t understand.’‘Whenever we are in danger from the SS we hand it over and sometimes it stops them from hitting us. If we take one to a mealtime we might even get extra rations.’Lale gently strokes her face. That he cannot protect the girl he loves anguishes him greatly. Gita leans back down and continues her search. Grabbing a handful of grass, she throws it at Lale with a smile. He grins back. Playfully he nudges her over and she lies on her back. Leaning over her he plucks a handful of grass and slowly lets it sprinkle down onto her face. She blows it away. Another handful of grass goes onto her neck and the top of her chest. She leaves it there. He undoes the top button on her shirt, drops more grass and watches it disappear down her cleavage.‘May I kiss you?’ he asks.‘Why would you want to? I haven’t brushed my teeth for I don’t know how long.’‘Me neither, so I guess we cancel each other out.’Gita answers him by raising her head towards his. 82

Chapter 9March 1943Lale reports to the administration office to get his instructions. The weather is improving slowly. There has been no snow for a week. On entering, he sweeps his eyes around the office to make sure Gita is where she should be. There she is, still seated beside Cilka. The two have become very close and Dana and Ivana seem to have welcomed Cilka fully into their little circle. His customary wink to the two of them is acknowledged with suppressed smiles. He approaches the Polish girl behind the counter.‘Good morning, Bella. It’s a lovely day outside.’‘Good morning, Lale,’  Bella responds. ‘I have your work here. I’ve been told to tell you that all the numbers today are to have the letter Z in front of them.’Lale looks  down  at the list  of  numbers  and  sure enough each one  is prefixed with the letter Z.‘Do you know what this signifies?’‘No, Lale, I’m not told anything. You know more than I do. I just follow instructions.’‘As do I, Bella. Thanks, I’ll see you later.’ Holding the instructions, Lale heads out the door. ‘Lale,’ Bella calls out.He turns back to her. With her head turned towards Gita, she asks, ‘Haven’t you forgotten something?’Smiling at her, he turns to Gita and raises his eyebrows at her. Several girls hold a hand over their mouth, eyes on the lookout for the SS who oversee their work.•Leon is waiting for Lale outside. Lale fills him in as they walk to their workstation. Trucks are unloading their cargo nearby and the men do a double-take as they register there are children among those being helped down, along with older men and women. Children have never been seen before at Birkenau.‘Surely we’re not marking kids. I’ll not do that,’ Leon pronounces. ‘Here comes Baretski. He’ll tell us what to do. Don’t say a word.’67

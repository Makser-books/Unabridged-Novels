had happened to you,’ he says.‘As you predicted, they found work for me.’ ‘So you’re a guard?’‘Not just a guard, my friend.’ Jakub’s voice is grim. ‘Sit and eat and I will tell you what I do here and what will happen to you.’Apprehensively, Lale sits and looks at the food Jakub has given him. A thin, dirty broth containing a single piece of potato. Starving a few moments ago, he finds his appetite has now left him.‘I have never forgotten your kindness,’ Jakub says. ‘I was sure I would die of starvation the night I arrived here, and there you were to feed me.’‘Well, you need more food than most.’‘I’ve heard stories of you smuggling food. Are they true?’‘That’s why I’m in here. The prisoners working in the Canada smuggle me money and gems and I use them to buy food and medicine from the villagers, which I distribute. I guess someone missed out and told on me.’‘You don’t know who?’ ‘Do you?’‘No, it’s not my job to know. My job is to get names from you – names of prisoners who might be planning to escape or resist, and of course the names of the prisoners who get the money and jewels to you.’Lale looks away. The enormity of what Jakub is saying begins to register. ‘Like you, Tätowierer, I do what I have to do, to survive.’Lale nods.‘I am to beat you until you give me names. I am a killer, Lale.’Lale shakes his hanging head, mutters every swear word he knows.‘I have no choice.’Mixed emotions race through Lale. Names of dead prisoners flit through his mind. Could he give Jakub those names? No. They’ll find out eventually, and then I’ll be back here again.‘The thing is,’ Jakub says, ‘I can’t let you give me any names.’ Lale stares, confused.     ‘You were kind to me and I will make the beating look worse than it is, but will kill you before I let you tell me a name. I want as little innocent blood on my hands as possible,’ Jakub explains.115

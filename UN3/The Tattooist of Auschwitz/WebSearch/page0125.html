knows  the officer’s  name  and can ask  him  for  help. Marking himself as friendly with the enemy brings acute shame, but he needs this.‘Maybe … What is it?’ Baretski looks uncomfortable. ‘Can you get a message to Gita?’‘Do you really want her to know where you are? Isn’t it better that she thinks you’re already dead?’‘Just tell her exactly where I am – Block 31 – and tell her to tell Cilka.’ ‘You want her friend to know where you are?’‘Yes, it’s important. She’ll understand.’‘Hmm. I’ll do it if I feel like it. Is it true you had a fortune in diamonds under your mattress?’‘Did they mention the rubies, emeralds, the Yankee dollars, the British and South African pounds?’Baretski shakes his head, laughing, slapping Lale painfully on the back as he walks off.‘Cilka. Gita must tell Cilka,’ he calls after him. A backward wave of Baretski’s arm dismisses Lale.•Baretski enters the women’s camp as they are lining up for dinner. Cilka sees him approach the kapo and then point at Gita. The kapo beckons Gita with her finger. Cilka draws Dana in close as Gita slowly walks over to Baretski. They cannot hear what he says, but his message causes Gita to cover her face with her hands. She then turns towards her friends and runs back into their arms.‘He’s alive! Lale is alive,’ she says. ‘He said I’m to tell you, Cilka, that he is in Block 31.’Why me?’‘I don’t know, but he said Lale had insisted I tell you.’ ‘What can she do?’ Dana asks.Cilka looks away, her mind working feverishly.‘I don’t know,’ says Gita, not in the mood to analyse. ‘I only know that he is alive.’‘Cilka, what can you do? How can you help?’ Dana pleads. ‘I will think about it,’ says Cilka.123

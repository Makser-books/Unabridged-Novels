The length of wood with a needle embedded in it moves quickly and painfully. Then the man takes a rag dipped in green ink and rubs it roughly over Lale’s wound.The tattooing has taken only seconds, but Lale’s shock makes time stand still. He grasps his arm, staring at the number. How can someone do this to another human being?  He wonders if for the rest of his life, be it short or long, he will be defined by this moment, this irregular number: 32407.A  prod from a rifle butt breaks Lale’s trance. He collects his jacket from the ground and stumbles forward, following the men in front into a large brick building with bench seating along the walls. It reminds him of the gymnasium at the school in Prague where he slept for five days before beginning his journey here.‘Strip.’‘Faster, faster.’The SS bark out orders that the majority of the men cannot understand. Lale translates for those nearby, who pass the word along.‘Leave your clothes on the bench. They will be here after you’ve had your shower.’Soon the group are removing trousers and shirts, jackets and shoes, folding their filthy clothes and placing them neatly on the benches.Lale is cheered at the prospect of water but knows he will probably not see his clothes again, nor the money inside them.He takes off his clothes and places them on the bench, but outrage threatens to overwhelm him. From his trouser pocket he removes a slim packet of matches, a reminder of past pleasures, and steals a glance at the nearest officer. The man is looking away. Lale strikes a match. This might be the final act of his own free will. He holds the match to the lining of his jacket, covers it with his trousers and hurries to join the line of men at the showers. Behind him, within seconds, he hears screams of ‘Fire!’  Lale looks back, sees naked men pushing and shoving to get away as an SS officer attempts to beat out the flames.He hasn’t yet reached the showers but finds himself shivering. What have I done? He’s just spent several days telling everyone around him to keep their heads down, do as they’re told, don’t antagonise anyone, and now he’s gone and lit a bloody fire inside a building. He has little doubt what would happen if someone pointed him out as the arsonist. Stupid. Stupid.In the shower block, he settles himself, breathes deeply. Hundreds of12

‘And being a teacher of economics got you here? How?’‘Well, Lale, a man who lectures on taxation and interest rates can’t help but get involved in the politics of his country. Politics will help you understand the world until you don’t understand it anymore, and then it will get you thrown into a prison camp. Politics and religion both.’‘And will you go back to that life when you leave here?’ ‘An optimist! I don’t know what my future holds, or yours.’ ‘No crystal ball then.’‘No, indeed.’Through the noise of construction, dogs barking and guards shouting, Pepan leans forward and asks, ‘Are you as strong in character as you are physically?’Lale returns Pepan’s gaze. ‘I’m a survivor.’‘Your strength can be a weakness, given the circumstances we find ourselves in. Charm and an easy smile will get you in trouble.’‘I am a survivor.’‘Well, then maybe I can help you survive in here.’ ‘You have friends in high places?’Pepan laughs and slaps Lale on the back. ‘No. No friends in high places. Like I told you, I am the Tätowierer. And I have been told the number of people coming here will be increasing very soon.’They sit with the thought for a moment. What lodges in Lale’s mind is that, somewhere, someone is making decisions, plucking numbers from – where?How do you decide who comes here? What information do you base those decisions on? Race, religion, or politics?‘You intrigue me, Lale. I was drawn to you. You had a strength that even your sick body couldn’t hide. It brought you to this point, sitting in front of me today.’Lale hears the words but struggles with what Pepan is saying. They sit in a place where people are dying every day, every hour, every minute.‘Would you like a job working with me?’ Pepan brings Lale back from the bleakness. ‘Or are you happy doing whatever they have you doing?’‘I do what I can to survive.’ ‘Then take my job offer.’25

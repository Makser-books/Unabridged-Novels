‘If anyone moves they will be shot,’ barks the SS officer, raising his rifle. ‘There will be no second chances.’The officer leaves and the prisoner who conducted the rollcall addresses the group. ‘You heard him,’ says the man, in Polish-accented German. ‘I am your kapo, your boss.  You will form two lines to get your food. Anyone complaining will suffer consequences.’The men jockey into line and several start whispering among themselves, asking if anyone has understood what ‘the German’  said. Lale tells those nearest to him and asks them to pass it along. He will translate as much as he can.As he reaches the front of the line he gratefully accepts a small tin cup, its contents slopping over the rough hands that thrust it at him. He steps aside and examines his meal. It is brown, contains nothing solid and has a smell he cannot identify. It is neither tea, coffee, nor soup. He fears he will bring the foul liquid back up if he drinks it slowly. So he closes his eyes, pinches his nostrils with his fingers and gulps it down. Others are not so successful.Aron, standing nearby, raises his cup in a mock toast. ‘I got a piece of potato, what about you?’‘Best meal I’ve had in ages.’ ‘Are you always so upbeat?’‘Ask me again at the end of the day,’ Lale says with a wink. Returning his empty cup to the prisoner who handed it to him, Lale thanks him with a quick nod and half a smile.The kapo shouts, ‘When you lazy bastards have finished your dining, get back into line! You have work to do!’Lale passes on the instruction.‘You’ll follow me,’ the kapo shouts, ‘and you’ll follow the instructions of the foreman. Any slacking off, I’ll know about it.’•Lale and the others find themselves in front of a partially erected building, a replica of their own block. Other prisoners are already there: carpenters and bricklayers all quietly labouring in the established rhythm of people used to working together.‘You. Yes, you. Get up on the roof. You can work up there.’The command is directed at Lale. Looking around, he spies a ladder going up to the roof. Two prisoners squat there, waiting to receive the tiles which18

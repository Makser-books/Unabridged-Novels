‘You want me to tattoo other men?’ ‘Someone has to do it.’‘I don’t think I could do that. Scar someone, hurt someone – it does hurt, you know.’Pepan pulls back his sleeve to reveal his own number. ‘It hurts like hell. If you don’t take the job, someone with less soul than you will, and hurt these people more.’‘Working for the kapo is not the same as defiling hundreds of innocent people.’A long silence follows. Lale again enters his dark place. Do those making the decisions have a family, a wife, children, parents? They can’t possibly.‘You can tell yourself that, but you are still a Nazi puppet. Whether it is with me or the kapo, or building blocks, you are still doing their dirty work.’‘You have a way of putting things.’‘So?’‘Then, yes. If you can arrange it, I will work for you.’‘Not for me. With me. But you must work quickly and efficiently and not make trouble with the SS.’‘OK.’Pepan stands, goes to walk away. Lale grabs at his shirtsleeve. ‘Pepan, why have you chosen me?’‘I saw a half-starved young man risk his life to save you. I figure you must be someone worth saving. I’ll come for you tomorrow morning. Get some rest now.’•    That night as his block-mates return, Lale notices that Aron is missing. He asks the two others sharing his bed what has happened to him, how long he’s been gone.‘About a week,’ comes the reply. Lale’s stomach drops.‘The kapo couldn’t find you,’ the man says. ‘Aron could have told him you were ill, but he feared the kapo would add you to the death cart again if he knew, so he said you were already gone.’26

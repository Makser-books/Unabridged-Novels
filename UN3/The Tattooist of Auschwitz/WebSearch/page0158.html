They shrug.‘Just make sure you return anything you don’t give away,’ the accountant officer says.Putting the money in one pocket and the jewels in another, Lale follows Fredrich to a large garage block by the chalet. Fredrich commandeers a jeep, Lale gets in and they drive the few kilometres into the village Lale came through yesterday. Was it only yesterday? How can I feel so different already?During the journey Fredrich tells him they will drive a small truck in to pick up the girls in the evening. It isn’t comfortable, but it’s the only vehicle they have that can take twelve. As they enter the village, Lale asks, ‘So, where should I look for likely girls?’‘I’ll drop you at the top of the street. Go into all the shops.  Workers or customers, it doesn’t matter as long as they are young and preferably pretty. Find their price, show them the payment – if they want something upfront give them cash only. Tell them we will pick them up at six o’clock outside the bakery. Some have been before.’‘How will I know if they’re already attached?’‘They’ll say no, I’m thinking. They might also throw something at you, so be prepared to duck.’ As Lale gets out, he says, ‘I’ll be waiting and watching. Take your time. And don’t do anything stupid.’Lale heads to a nearby boutique, hoping no husbands or boyfriends have gone shopping with their partners today. Everyone looks at him when he enters. He says hello in Russian, before remembering he is in Austria and switching to German.‘Hello, ladies, how are you today?’The women look at each other. A few giggle before a shop attendant asks, ‘Can I help you? Are you looking for something for your wife?’‘Not exactly. I want to talk to all of you.’‘Are you Russian?’ a customer asks.‘No, I’m Slovakian. However, I am here on behalf of the Russian army.’ ‘Are you staying in the chalet?’ asks another customer.‘Yes.’To Lale’s relief one of the shop attendants speaks up, ‘Are you here to see if we want to party tonight?’156

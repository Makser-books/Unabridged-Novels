The door closes and Jakub quickly releases Lale, laying him gently on the floor. With a cloth hidden in his shirt he wipes the blood from Lale’s body and gently pulls up his pants for him.‘I’m so sorry, Lale.’He helps him to his feet, carries him back to his room and lays him on his stomach.‘You did good. You’ll need to sleep like this for a while. I’ll come back later with some water and a clean shirt. Get some rest now.’•Over the next few days Jakub visits Lale each day with food and water and the occasional change of shirt. He reports to Lale the extent of his injuries and that they are healing. Lale knows he will be marked for life.  Perhaps the Tätowierer deserves that.‘How many times did you strike me?’ Lale asks.‘I don’t know.’‘Yes, you do.’‘It’s over, Lale, and you’re healing. Leave it alone.’‘Did you break my nose? I’m having trouble breathing through it.’‘Probably, but not too bad. The swelling’s gone down and it’s hardly out of shape. You’re still handsome. You’ll still have the girls chasing you.’‘I don’t want girls chasing me.’ ‘Why not?’‘I’ve found the one I want.’The next day the door opens and Lale looks up to greet Jakub but instead there are two SS officers. They indicate for Lale to get to his feet and come with them. Lale stays sitting as he tries to compose himself. Can this be the end?  Am I for the Black  Wall?  He silently says his goodbyes to his family and, lastly, to Gita. The SS become impatient, step into his room and point their rifles at him. He follows them outside on trembling legs. Feeling the sun on his face for the first time in more than a week he staggers along, between the two officers. Looking up, preparing to meet his fate, he sees several other prisoners being bundled into a nearby truck. Maybe this isn’t the end. His legs give out and the officers drag him the remaining short distance. They throw him on and he doesn’t look back. He clings to the side of the truck all the way to Birkenau.119

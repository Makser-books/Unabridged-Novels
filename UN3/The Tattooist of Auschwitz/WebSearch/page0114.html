Chapter 19‘Have you lost your faith?’  Gita asks, as she leans back into Lale’s chest at their place behind the administration building. She has chosen this moment to ask the question as she wants to hear his response, not see it.‘Why do you ask?’ he says, stroking the back of her head. ‘Because I think you have,’ she says, ‘and that saddens me.’ ‘Then clearly you haven’t?’‘I asked first.’‘Yes, I think I have.’‘When?’‘The first night I arrived here. I told you what happened, what I saw. How any merciful god could let that happen, I don’t know. And nothing has happened since that night to change my mind. Quite the opposite.’‘You have to believe in something.’‘I do. I believe in you and me and getting out of here, and making a life together where we can –’‘I know, whenever and wherever we want.’ She sighs. ‘Oh, Lale, if only.’ Lale turns her around to face him.‘I will not be defined by being a Jew,’ he says. ‘I won’t deny it, but I am a man first, a man in love with you.’‘And if I want to keep my faith? If it is still important to me?’‘I have no say in that.’‘Yes, you do.’They fall into an uneasy silence. He watches her, her eyes downcast.‘I have no problem with you keeping your faith,’ says Lale gently. ‘In fact, I will encourage your faith if it means a lot to you and keeps you by my side. When we leave here, I will encourage you to practise your faith, and when our babies come along, they can follow their mother’s faith. Does that satisfy you?’‘Babies?  I  don’t  know  if  I  will  be  able to  have  children.  I  think I’m screwed up inside.’112

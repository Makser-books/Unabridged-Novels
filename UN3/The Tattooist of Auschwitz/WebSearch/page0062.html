Later that day, Gita hears a familiar voice and looks up. Lale has entered the room and is handing papers to one of the civilian girls working on the front desk. Finishing his conversation, he slowly scans all the faces. As his glance passes Gita, he winks. She can’t help herself – she gasps, and a few women turn to look at her. The girl beside her nudges her in the ribs as Lale hurries from the room.•With the day’s work ended, Gita sees Lale standing a distance away, watching the girls leave the administration building for their blocks. The heavy SS presence prevents him from approaching. As the girls walk together, they talk.‘I’m Cilka,’ Gita’s new colleague says. ‘I’m in Block 25.’ ‘I’m Gita, Block 29.’As the girls enter the women’s camp, Dana and Ivana rush to Gita. ‘Are you all right? Where did they take you?  Why  did they take you?’  Dana demands, fear and relief on her face.‘I’m OK. They took me to work in the administration office.’ ‘How … ?’ Ivana asks.‘Lale. I think he somehow arranged it.’‘But you’re all right. They didn’t hurt you?’‘I’m fine. This is Cilka. I’m working with her.’Dana and Ivana greet Cilka with a hug. Gita smiles, happy that her friends are so immediately accepting of another girl in their midst. All afternoon she had worried how they would react to her now working in relative comfort, without having to deal with the cold or any physical effort. She could hardly blame them if they were jealous of her new role and felt she was no longer one of them.‘I’d better go to my block,’ says Cilka. ‘I’ll see you tomorrow, Gita.’Cilka walks off  and  Ivana  watches  her  go.  ‘Gosh,  she’s  pretty.  Even dressed in rags she’s beautiful.’‘Yes, she is. She’s been throwing me little smiles all day, just enough to reassure me. Her beauty goes beyond the surface.’Cilka turns back and smiles at the three of them. Then, with one hand, she removes the scarf from her head and waves it to them, revealing long dark hair cascading down her back. She moves with the grace of a swan, a young woman unaware of her own beauty and seemingly untouched by the horror around her.60

A moment passes before they react. Then both girls throw their arms around him and hug him tightly. Dana cries. No tears come from Gita. Lale releases them and takes each by the hand.‘Both still beautiful,’ he tells them.Gita smacks him on the arm with her free hand.‘I thought you were dead. Again. I thought I’d never see you again.’ ‘Me too,’ says Dana.‘But I’m not. Thanks to you, and to Cilka, I’m not. I’m here with the two of you, where I should be.’‘But …’ cries Gita.Lale pulls her towards him and holds her securely.Dana kisses him on the cheek. ‘I’ll leave you two. It’s so good to see you, Lale. I thought Gita would die of a broken heart if you didn’t come back soon.’‘Thank you, Dana,’ says Lale. ‘You’re a good friend, to both of us.’ She walks off, the smile not leaving her face.Hundreds of prisoners mill around the compound, as Lale and Gita stand there, not knowing what to do next.‘Close your eyes,’ Lale says. ‘What?’‘Close them and count to ten.’ ‘But –’‘Just do it.’One eye at a time, Gita does as she is told. She counts to ten, then opens them. ‘I don’t understand.’‘I’m still here. I’ll never leave you again.’‘Come on, we have to keep moving,’ she tells him.They walk towards the women’s camp. With no bribe for the kapo, Lale can’t risk Gita being late back. They lean gently in towards each other.‘I don’t know how much longer I can stand this.’‘It can’t last forever, my darling. Just hang in there, please hang in there. We’ll have the rest of our lives together.’128

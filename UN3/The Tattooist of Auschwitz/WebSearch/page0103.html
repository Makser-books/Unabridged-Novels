‘I can help if you want some extra food, but that’s about it. Where is the boy right now?’‘He’s outside.’‘Outside this building?’‘Yeah.’‘For god’s sake, get him in here at once,’ Lale says, opening the door.One of the boys hurries outside and soon returns with a young man, head bowed, shivering with fear. Lale points to the bed and he sits. His eyes are puffy.‘Your friends tell me you escaped.’ ‘Yes, sir.’‘How did you do that?’‘Well, I was working outside and I asked the guard if I could take a crap. He told me to go into the trees because he didn’t want to smell it. Then when I went to return to my detail they were all walking off. I was worried if I ran after them I might get shot by one of the other guards, so I just walked back into the forest.’‘And?’ asked Lale.‘Well, I kept walking, didn’t I? Then I got caught when I went into a village to steal some food. I was starving. The soldiers saw my tattooed number and brought me back here.’‘And now they’re going to hang you tomorrow morning, right?’The boy’s head drops. Lale reflects that this is how he will look tomorrow when the life has been strangled from him.‘Is there anything you can do to help us, Tätowierer?’Lale paces his small room. He pulls up the boy’s sleeve and studies his number. One of mine. He returns to pacing. The boys sit silently.‘Stay here,’ he says firmly, grabs his bag and hurries from the room.Searchlights scan the compound outside, as do violent eyes looking for someone to kill. Hugging buildings, Lale makes his way to the administration block and enters the main office. He is instantly relieved to see Bella behind the desk. She looks up at him.‘Lale, what are you doing here? I have no work for you.’101

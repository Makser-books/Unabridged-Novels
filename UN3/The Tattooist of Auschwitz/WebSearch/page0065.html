When he has finished eating, Lale asks, ‘Where are you from?’‘America.’‘How did you end up here?’‘I was visiting my family in Poland and got trapped here – I couldn’t leave–and then we got rounded up, and here I am. I don’t know where my familyare. We got separated.’‘But you live in America?’‘Yes.’‘Shit, that’s tough.’‘What’s your name?’ Jakub asks.‘I’m Lale. They call me the Tätowierer  and,  like me,  you  will  do  well here.’‘I don’t understand. What do you mean?’‘Your size. The Germans are the cruellest bastards ever to live, but they are not entirely stupid. They have a knack for finding the right person for the right job and I’m sure they will find work for you.’‘What kind of work?’‘I don’t know. You’ll have to wait and see. Do you know what block you are assigned to?’‘Block 7.’‘Ah, I know it well. Come on, let’s sneak you in. You’d better be there to answer when your number is called out in a couple of hours.’•Two days later it is Sunday. Having worked the past five Sundays, Lale has missed Gita terribly. Today the sun is shining down on him as he walks the compound, looking for her. As he rounds the corner of one block, he is startled by cheering and applause. Such noises are unheard of in the camp. Lale pushes his way through a crowd to reach its focus. There, centre stage, surrounded by both prisoners and SS, Jakub is performing.Three men carry a large piece of timber to him. He takes it and tosses it away. Prisoners have to scramble to get out of the way. Another prisoner produces a large metal rod, which Jakub sets about bending in half. The show goes on for some time as heavier and heavier items are brought to Jakub for him to display his strength.63

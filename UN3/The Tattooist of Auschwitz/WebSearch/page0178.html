He was transported to Auschwitz on 23 April 1942 and tattooed with the number 32407.Gita was born Gisela Fuhrmannova (Furman) on 11 March 1925 in Vranov nad  Topl’ou, Slovakia.

It was discovered after his death.Lale was imprisoned in the Strafkompanie (penal unit) from 16 June to 10 July 1944, where he was tortured by Jakub. No one was expected to survive or be released from that unit.Gita’s  neighbour  Mrs  Goldstein survived  and  made  her  way home to Vranov nad Topl’ou.Cilka was charged as a Nazi conspirator and sentenced to fifteen years’ hard labour, which she served in Siberia. Afterwards she returned to Bratislava. She and Gita met only once, in the mid-1970s, when Gita went to visit her two brothers.In 1961 Stefan Baretski was tried in Frankfurt and sentenced to life imprisonment for war crimes. On 21 June 1988 he committed suicide in the Konitzky-Sift Hospital in Bad Nauheim, Germany.Gita died on 3 October 2003. Lale died on 31 October 2006.176

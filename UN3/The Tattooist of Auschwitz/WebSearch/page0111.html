Instead, he goes back to his block, where he is greeted by wailing and crying. The women cradle young boys and girls who have suffered bullet wounds.‘They saw the plane and joined the other prisoners running around in the compound,’ says one of the men.‘What can I do to help?’‘Take the other children inside. They don’t need to see this.’ ‘Sure.’‘Thanks, Lale. I’ll send the old women in to help you. I don’t know what to do with the bodies. I can’t leave them here.’‘The SS will be around to pick up the dead, I’m sure.’ It sounds so callous, matter of fact. Tears burn behind Lale’s eyes. He shuffles on the spot. ‘I’m so sorry.’‘What are they going to do with us?’ the man says. ‘I don’t know what fate lies in store for any of us.’ ‘To die here?’‘Not if I can help it, but I don’t know.’Lale sets about gathering the young boys and girls to shepherd them indoors. Some cry, some are too shocked to cry. Several of the older women join him. They take the surviving children to the far end of the block and start telling them stories, but this time they don’t work. The children cannot be comforted. Most of them remain in a silent state of trauma.Lale goes to his room and returns with chocolate, which he and Nadya break up and offer around. Some of the children take it, others look at it as if it too will harm them. There is nothing more he can do. Nadya takes him by the hand, raising him to his feet.‘Thank you. You have done all you can.’ She brushes his cheek with the back of her hand. ‘Leave us now.’‘I’ll go and help the men,’ Lale responds in a faltering voice.He staggers off outside. There, he helps the men gather the small bodies into a pile for the SS to take away. He notices they are already picking up the bodies that lie in the compound. Several mothers refuse to hand over their precious children and it is heartbreaking to Lale, to see small lifeless forms being wrenched from their mothers’ arms.     ‘Yisgadal  veyiskadash  shmei  rabbah  –  May  his  name  be  magnified  and made holy …’ Lale recites the Kaddish in a whisper.109

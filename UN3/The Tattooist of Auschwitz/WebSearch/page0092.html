They feel like words he’s waited all his life to say.‘Why?  Why  would  you  say  that?  Look  at  me.  I’m  ugly,  I’m  dirty.  My hair … I used to have lovely hair.’‘I love your hair the way it is now, and I will love it the way it will be in the future.’‘But we have no future.’Lale holds her firmly around her waist, forces her to meet his gaze.‘Yes, we do. There will be a tomorrow for us. On the night I arrived here I made a vow to myself that I would survive this hell.  We will survive and make a life where we are free to kiss when we want to, make love when we want to.’Gita blushes and turns away. He gently moves her face back to him. ‘To make love wherever, whenever we want to. Do you hear me?’ Gita nods.‘Do you believe me?’‘I want to, but –’‘No buts. Just believe me. Now, you’d better get back to your block before your kapo starts wondering.’As Lale begins to walk off, Gita pulls him back and kisses him hard. Breaking the kiss, he says, ‘Maybe I should stay away more often.’ ‘Don’t you dare,’ she says, hitting him on the chest.•That night Ivana and Dana pepper Gita with questions, relieved to see their friend smiling again.‘Did you tell him about your family?’ says Dana.‘No.’‘Why not?’‘I can’t. It’s too painful to talk about … and he was so happy to see me.’‘Gita, if he loves you as he says he does, he would want to know you have lost your family. He would want to comfort you.’‘You  might  be  right,  Dana,  but if  I  tell him then we’ll both  be sad, and  I want our time together to be different. I want to forget where I am and what’s happened to my family.90

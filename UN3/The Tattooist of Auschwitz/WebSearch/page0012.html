Many stumble, the muscles in their legs refusing to work after days without use. Suitcases, bundles of books, meagre possessions are snatched from those unwilling to surrender them or who simply don’t understand the orders. They are then hit by a rifle or fist. Lale studies the men in uniform. Black and threatening. The twin lightning bolts on the collar of their jackets tell Lale who he is dealing with. The SS. Under different circumstances he might appreciate the tailoring, the fineness of the cloth, the sharpness of the cut.He places his suitcase on the ground. How will they know this one is mine?With a shiver, he realises that it’s unlikely he will see the case or its contents again. He touches his hand to his heart, to the money hidden in his jacket pocket. He looks to the heavens, breathes in the fresh, cool air, and reminds himself that at least he is outdoors.A  gunshot rings out and Lale jumps. Before him stands an SS officer, weapon pointed skywards. ‘Move!’  Lale glances back at the emptied train. Clothing blows away and books flap open. Several trucks arrive and small boys clamber out. They snatch up the abandoned belongings and throw them into the trucks.  A  heaviness settles between Lale’s shoulder blades.  Sorry, Mumma, they have your books.The men trudge towards the looming dirty pink brick buildings, with picture windows. Trees line the entrance, flush with new spring growth. As Lale walks through open iron gates he looks up at the German words wrought from the metal.ARBEIT MACHT FREI Work will make you free.He doesn’t know where he is, or what work he is expected to do, but the idea that it will set him free has the feeling of a sick joke.SS, rifles, dogs, his belongings taken – this he’d been unable to imagine. ‘Where are we?’Lale turns to see Aron at his side.‘The end of the line, I’d say.’Aron’s face falls.‘Just do as you’re told, you’ll be fine.’  Lale knows he doesn’t sound terribly convincing. He gives Aron a quick smile, which is returned. Silently, Lale tells himself to take his own advice:  Do as you’re told. And always observe.10

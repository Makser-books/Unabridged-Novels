Chapter 6Weeks  have gone  by; the trees surrounding the camp  have dropped  their leaves, the days have become shorter as winter advances.Who are these people?  Lale has been asking himself this question ever since he arrived in the camp. These groups of men who work on the construction sites who appear every day dressed in civilian clothing, never to be seen after tools down. With a spring in his step from his time with Gita, Lale feels sure he can talk to a couple of the men without the SS getting worked up and taking a shot at him. And he has his bag-shaped shield.Lale strolls casually towards one of the new brick buildings under construction. These don’t seem to be blocks to house prisoners, but their use is of no concern to Lale today. He approaches two men, one older than the other, busily engaged in bricklaying, and squats down beside a pile of bricks awaiting placement. The two men watch him with interest, slowing their work rate. Lale picks up a brick and pretends to study it.‘I don’t get it,’ he speaks quietly.‘What don’t you get?’ the older man asks.‘I’m a Jew. They’ve branded me with a yellow star. Around me I see political prisoners, murderers and lazy men who won’t work. And then you –you wear no brand.’‘That’s none of your business, Jew boy,’ says the younger man, himself no more than a boy.‘Just being friendly. You know how it is – checking out my surrounds and I became curious about you and your friends. My name is Lale.’‘Get lost!’ the young one says.‘Settle down, boy. Don’t mind him,’ the older man says to Lale, his voice rough from too many cigarettes. ‘My name’s Victor. The mouth here is my son  Yuri.’  Victor extends his hand, which Lale shakes. Lale then offers his hand to Yuri, but he doesn’t take it.‘We live nearby,’ Victor explains, ‘so we come here to work each day.’‘I  just want to get this straight.  You  come  here  each  day  voluntarily? I mean, you’re paid to be here?’Yuri pipes up. ‘That’s right Jew boy, we get paid and go home every night. You lot –’49

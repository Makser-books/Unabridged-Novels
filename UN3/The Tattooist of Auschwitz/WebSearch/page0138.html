A second explosion makes them look towards the  nearby crematorium, where smoke rises and pandemonium is breaking out. The Sonderkommando workers are running from the building, most of them towards the fence that surrounds the camp. Gunfire erupts from the top of the crematorium. Lale looks up and sees Sonderkommando up there, shooting wildly. The SS fire heavy machine guns in retaliation. Within minutes they have put an end to the shooting.‘What’s happening?’ Gita says.‘I don’t know. We need to get indoors.’Bullets strike the ground around them as the SS take aim at anyone in their sights. Lale pulls Gita up hard against a building. Another loud explosion.‘That’s Crematorium Four – someone’s blowing it up. We have to get out of here.’Prisoners run from the administration building and are gunned down. ‘I have to get you back to your block. It’s the only place you’ll be safe.’An  announcement  on  the loudspeakers: ‘All prisoners return to your blocks. You will not be fired upon if you go now.’‘Go, quickly.’‘I’m frightened, take me with you,’ she cries.‘You’ll be safer in your own block tonight. They’re bound to do a rollcall. My darling, you can’t get caught outside your block.’She hesitates.‘Go now. Stay in your block tonight, and go to work as normal tomorrow. You must not give them any reason to look for you.  You must wake up tomorrow.’She takes a deep breath and turns to run.In parting Lale says, ‘I’ll find you tomorrow. I love you.’•That night, Lale breaks his rule and joins the men, mostly Hungarians, in his block to find out what he can about the afternoon’s events. It appears some of the women working in an ammunition factory nearby had been smuggling tiny amounts of gunpowder back to Birkenau, pushed up into their fingernails. They had been getting it to the Sonderkommando, who made crude grenades out of sardine tins. They had also been stockpiling weapons, including small arms, knives and axes.136

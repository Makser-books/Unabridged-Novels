He grips Dana’s hand. ‘Tell her …’ Dana waits.‘Tell her I will take care of her.’Lale watches Dana run back into her block. He can’t move. Thoughts creep into his head. The death cart he sees every day – Black Mary, it’s called – she cannot end up on there. That must not be her fate. He looks around at the brave souls who have ventured outside. He imagines them dropping into the snow, and lying there, smiling up at him, thankful that death has taken them from this place.‘You cannot have her. I will not let you take her from me,’ he calls.Prisoners move away from him. The SS have chosen to stay inside on this bleak, dark day and soon Lale finds himself alone, paralysed by cold and fear. Finally he begins to move his feet. His mind rejoins the rest of his body. And he stumbles back to his room and collapses on his bed.•Daylight creeps into his room the next morning. The room feels empty, even of him. Looking down from above, he does not see himself. An out-of-body experience.  Where have I gone? I have to come back.  There’s something important for me to do. The memory of yesterday’s meeting with Dana jolts him back to reality.He grabs his bag, his boots, throws a blanket around his shoulders and runs from his room to the front gates. He doesn’t check who is around. He must get to Victor and Yuri immediately.The two men arrive with others in their detail, sinking into the snow with each step they take towards work. They see Lale and move away from the others, meeting him halfway. He shows Victor the gems and the currency in his hand, a small fortune’s worth. Everything he has he drops into  Victor’s bag.‘Penicillin or something similar,’ Lale says. ‘Can you help me?’Victor places his packages of food into Lale’s open bag and nods his head. ‘Yes.’Lale hurries over to Block 29 and watches from a distance.  Where are they? Why haven’t they appeared?  He paces up and down, oblivious to the eyes in the towers surrounding the camp. He must see Gita. She has to have made it through the night. Finally he sees Dana and Ivana, Gita hanging weakly from their shoulders.  Two other girls help to block the scene from easy view. Lale drops to his knees at the thought this could be the last time he sees her.56

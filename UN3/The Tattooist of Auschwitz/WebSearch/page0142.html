Lale’s heart leaps. ‘What can you tell me? Please.’ ‘The Russians, they’re nearly here.’Lale runs from the building to the women’s camp. The door to Block 29 is shut. No one stands guard outside. Entering, Lale finds the women huddled together at the back. Even Cilka is here. They gather around him, frightened and full of questions.‘All I can tell you is that the SS appear to be destroying records,’ Lale says. ‘One of them told me the Russians are nearby.’  He withholds the news that the camp is going to be emptying out the next day because he doesn’t want to cause further alarm by admitting that he doesn’t know where to.‘What do you think the SS are going to do with us?’ Dana asks.‘I don’t know. Let’s hope they will run off and let the Russians liberate the camp. I’ll try to find out more. I’ll come back and tell you what I learn. Don’t leave the block. There are bound to be some trigger-happy guards out there.’He takes Dana by both hands. ‘Dana, I don’t know what’s going to happen, but while I have the chance I want to tell you how much I will always be grateful to you for being Gita’s friend. I know you have kept her going many times when she has wanted to give up.’They embrace. Lale kisses her on the forehead and then hands her over to Gita. He turns to Cilka and Ivana and wraps them both in a bear hug.To Cilka, he says, ‘You are the bravest person I have ever met. You must not carry any guilt for what has happened here.  You are an innocent –remember that.’In between sobs she replies, ‘I did what I had to do to survive. If I hadn’t, someone else would have suffered at the hands of that pig.’‘I owe my life to you, Cilka, and I will never forget that.’ He turns to Gita.‘Don’t say anything,’ she says. ‘Don’t you dare say a word.’ ‘Gita …’‘No.  You  don’t get to  say  anything to me other than you’ll  see  me tomorrow. That’s all I want to hear from you.’Lale looks at these young women and realises that there is nothing left to say. They were brought to this camp as girls, and now – not one of them yet having reached the age of twenty-one – they are broken, damaged young women. He knows they will never grow to be the women they were meant to be.140

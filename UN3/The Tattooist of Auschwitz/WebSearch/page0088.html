Once again a chill spreads throughout his body. His hands shake. Lale picks up his pace, hurrying to a small table where another nurse sits with identification cards at the ready. She makes room for him to set up. He tries to control the shaking in his hands as he lines up his tools and ink bottles. He looks over at Mengele, who has another frightened girl in front of him, and is running his hands over her hair and down her breasts.‘Don’t be frightened, I’m not going to hurt you,’ Lale hears him tell her. Lale watches the girl shiver in fear.‘There, there. You’re safe, this is a hospital. We take care of people here.’Mengele turns to  a nearby  nurse.  ‘Get  a  blanket  for  this pretty young thing.’Turning back to the girl, he says, ‘I’ll take good care of you.’The girl is sent in Lale’s direction. Lale puts his head down and prepares to get into the rhythm of tattooing the numbers shown to him by the nurse assisting.When his work is complete, Lale leaves the building and looks again into the fenced area. It is empty. He drops to his knees and dry retches. He has nothing to bring up; the only fluid in his body is tears.•That night, Gita returns to her block to learn that there are several new arrivals. The established residents eye the newcomers with resentment. They don’t want to have to talk about the horrors that lie in store, nor share their rations.‘Gita. Is that you, Gita?’ a feeble voice calls out.Gita approaches the group of women, many of whom seem older. Older women are rarely seen in Birkenau, which is home to the young who can work.  A  woman steps forward, her arms outstretched. ‘Gita, it is me, your neighbour Hilda Goldstein.’Gita stares  and suddenly recognises a  neighbour from her hometown of Vranov nad Topl’ou, paler and thinner than when Gita saw her last.Memories flood Gita, scents and textures and flashes of the past: a familiar doorway, the aroma of chicken soup, a cracked bar of soap by the kitchen sink, happy voices on warm summer nights, her mother’s arms.‘Mrs  Goldstein …’ Gita moves closer, clasps the woman’s hand.  ‘They took you too.’86

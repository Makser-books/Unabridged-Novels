Mrs Molnar brings a glass of water. Cradling Goldie’s head lovingly in his arms, Lale waits for her to open her eyes. When she comes to, he offers her the water. She sobs, spilling most of it. Mrs Molnar lets herself quietly out as Lale rocks his sister, letting his own tears flow too. It is quite some time before he can speak and ask the questions he so desperately wants answers to.The news is bleak. His parents were taken away only days after he left. Goldie has no idea where they went, or if they are still alive. Max went off to join the partisans and was killed fighting the Germans. Max’s wife and their two small boys were taken, again she does not know where to. The only positive news Goldie has to offer is her own. She fell in love with a Russian and they are married. Her name is now Sokolov. Her husband is away on business and is due back in a few days.Lale follows her into the kitchen, not wanting to let her out of his sight, as she prepares a meal for them. After they have eaten, they talk late into the night. As much as Goldie pushes Lale for information about where he has been for the past three years, he will only say he has been in a work camp in Poland and that he is now home.The next day he pours his heart out to both his sister and Mrs Molnar about his love for Gita and how he believes she is still alive.‘You have to find her,’ Goldie says. ‘You must look for her.’ ‘I don’t know where to start looking.’‘Well, where did she come from?’ Mrs Molnar asks.‘I don’t know. She wouldn’t tell me.’‘Help me to understand this. You have known her three years and all that time she told you nothing about her origins?’‘She wouldn’t. She was meant to tell me on the day she left the camp, but everything happened too quickly. All I know is her surname: it’s Furman.’‘Well, that’s something, but not much,’ his sister chides him.‘I’ve heard that people are starting to come home from the camps,’ says Mrs Molnar. ‘They are all arriving in Bratislava. Maybe she’s there.’‘If I’m to go back to Bratislava, I need transport.’ Goldie smiles. ‘So what are you doing sitting here then?’In the town, Lale asks everyone he sees with a horse, bike, car, truck, if he can buy it from them. They all refuse.As he is starting to despair, an old man comes towards him in a small cart drawn by a single horse.165

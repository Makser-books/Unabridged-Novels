For the next several weeks Lale and Fredrich make their twice-daily trips into the village. He becomes well known there; even women who never come to the chalet know who he is and greet him in passing. The boutique and the cafe are his two favourite places and soon girls gather there at the time they know he will arrive. He is often greeted by his regulars with a kiss on the cheek and a request for him to join the partying that night. They seem genuinely upset that he never does.One day in the cafe, Serena, a waitress there, says loudly, ‘Lale, will you marry me when the war is over?’  The other girls there giggle, and the older women tut.‘She’s fallen for you, Lale. She doesn’t want any of those Russian pigs no matter how much money they have,’ one of the customers adds.‘You are a very beautiful girl, Serena, but I’m afraid my heart belongs to someone else.’‘Who? What’s her name?’ asks Serena indignantly.‘Her name is Gita and I am promised to her. I love her.’ ‘Is she waiting for you? Where is she?’‘I don’t know where she is right now, but I’ll find her.’ ‘How do you even know if she’s alive?’‘Oh, she’s alive. Have you ever just known something?’ ‘I’m not sure.’‘Then you’ve never been in love. I’ll see you girls later. Six o’clock. Don’t be late.’A chorus of goodbyes follows him out the door.•That night, as Lale adds a large ruby to his war chest, a terrible homesickness overtakes him. He sits on his bed for a long time. His memories of home have been tainted by his memories of the war. Everything and everyone he cared for is now only visible to him through glasses darkened by suffering and loss. When he manages to pull himself together, he empties the sock onto his bed and counts the gems he has managed to smuggle over the weeks. Then he wanders out onto the balcony. The nights are getting warmer and several of the partygoers are out on the lawn, some lounging about, others playing a kind of chase game. A knock on his bedroom door startles him. Since the first night, Lale has locked his door whether he is in the room or not. Rushing to open the door, Lale sees the gems on his bed and quickly pulls the covers over them. He doesn’t spot the latest ruby falling onto the floor.159

He is often reminded of his friends in the Gypsy camp and the stories they told him about their way of life. It is nearing the end of summer. The rain is frequent but doesn’t deter him.For two weeks Lale loiters at the train station as each arrival pulls in. He walks up and down the platform, approaching every disembarking woman. ‘Were you in Birkenau?’  On the few occasions he gets a yes, he asks, ‘Did you know Gita Furman? She was in Block 29.’ No one knows her.One day the stationmaster asks him if he has registered Gita with the Red Cross, who are taking the names of the missing and of those who have returned and are seeking loved ones. With nothing to lose, he heads into the city centre to the address he has been given.•Gita is walking down the main street with two friends when she sees a funny-looking cart being drawn by a horse.  A  young man stands casually in the back.She steps out onto the road.Time stands still as the horse stops of its own volition in front of the young woman.Lale climbs down from the cart.Gita takes a step towards him. He doesn’t move. She takes another step. ‘Hello,’ she says.Lale drops to his knees. Gita turns around to her two friends, who are looking on in astonishment.‘Is it him?’ one of them calls out. ‘Yes,’ says Gita. ‘It is him.’Clearly Lale is not going to move, or is incapable of moving, so Gita walks to him. Kneeling down in front of him, she says, ‘In case you didn’t hear me when we left Birkenau, I love you.’‘Will you marry me?’ he says.‘Yes, I will.’‘Will you make me the happiest man in the world?’‘Yes.’Lale  sweeps  Gita  up  into his arms and  kisses  her.    One    of    Gita’s friendscomes over and leads the horse away. Then, with Gita’s arms around Lale’s waist and her head resting on his shoulder, they walk away, merging into the crowded street, one young couple among many in a war-ravaged city. 167

‘I’m meant to believe that?’‘Yes, sir. They bring it to me, but I do not ask them their names.’ Houstek slams his fist on the desk, causing the gems to jangle.‘This makes me very angry, Tätowierer. You are good at your job. Now I will have to find someone else to do it.’  He turns to the escorting officers. ‘Take him to Block 11. He’ll soon remember the names there.’Lale is marched out and placed in a truck. Two SS officers sit either side of him, each ramming a pistol into his ribs. During the four-kilometre drive Lale silently says goodbye to Gita and the future they were just imagining. Closing his eyes, he mentally says the names of each of his family members. He cannot picture his siblings as clearly as he used to. His mother he can see perfectly. But how do you say goodbye to your mother? The person who gave you breath, who taught you how to live? He cannot say goodbye to her. He gasps as his father’s image comes before him, causing one of the officers to push his pistol harder into his ribs. The last time he saw his father he was crying. He doesn’t want this to be how he remembers him, so he searches for another image and comes up with his father working with his beloved horses. He always spoke so warmly to them in contrast to the way he expressed himself to his children. Lale’s brother Max, older and wiser. He tells him he hopes he hasn’t let him down, that he has tried to act as Max would have in his place. When he thinks of his little sister, Goldie, the pain is too much.The truck comes to a sudden halt, throwing Lale against the officer next to him.He is placed in a small room in Block 11. The reputation of Blocks 10 and 11 are well known. They are the punishment blocks. Behind these secluded torture houses stands the Black Wall, the execution wall. Lale expects that he will be taken there after being tortured.For two days he sits in the cell, the only light coming in through a crack under the door. While he listens to the cries and screams of others, he relives every moment he has spent with Gita.On the third day, he is blinded by sunlight spilling into the room. A large man blocks the doorway and hands him a bowl of liquid. Lale takes it, and as his eyes adjust, he recognises the man.‘Jakub, is that you?’Jakub enters the room, the low ceiling forcing him to stoop.‘Tätowierer. What are you doing here?’ Jakub is visibly shocked.Lale struggles to his feet, his hand outstretched. ‘I often wondered what114

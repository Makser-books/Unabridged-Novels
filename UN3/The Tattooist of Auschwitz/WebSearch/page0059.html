‘What are you doing down there?’ Baretski appears behind him.He staggers to his feet. ‘I was feeling sick, but I’m OK now.’‘Maybe you should see a doctor. You know we have several at Auschwitz.’ ‘No, thanks, I’d rather ask you to shoot me.’Baretski withdraws his pistol from its holster. ‘If this is where you want to die, Tätowierer, I would be happy to oblige.’‘I’m sure you would, but not today,’ Lale says. ‘I take it we’ve got work to do?’Baretski holsters his gun. ‘Auschwitz,’ he says, as he begins walking. ‘And take that blanket back to where you found it. You look ridiculous.’•Lale and Leon spend the morning at Auschwitz, tattooing numbers on frightened newcomers and attempting to soften the shock of it. But Lale’s mind is on Gita and several times he presses too hard.In the afternoon, when the job is finished, Lale half walks, half runs back to Birkenau. He meets Dana near the entrance to Block 29 and gives her all his rations from breakfast.‘We made a bed for her out of clothing,’  Dana says as she folds the food into makeshift shirt cuffs, ‘and we fed her water from pieces of snow.  We took her back to the block this afternoon, but she’s still in a really bad way.’Lale squeezes Dana’s hand. ‘Thank you. Try and get some food into her. I’ll have medicine tomorrow.’He departs, his mind a whirlpool. I barely know Gita, yet how can I live if she does not?That night, sleep evades him.The next morning,  Victor places medicine, along with  food,  into Lale’s bag.That afternoon, he is able to get it to Dana.•In the evening, Dana and Ivana sit beside a now fully unconscious Gita. The pull of typhus is stronger than they are; the black stillness has completely overtaken her. They talk to her but she gives no sign that she hears them. From a small vial, Dana places several drops of liquid into Gita’s mouth as Ivana holds it open.57

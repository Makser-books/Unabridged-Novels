Chapter 4As they walk to Auschwitz, Baretski seems in a jovial mood and peppers Lale with questions. ‘How old are you?’  ‘What did you do before, you know, before you were brought here?’For the most part Lale answers with a question, and discovers Baretski likes talking about himself. He learns he is only a year younger than Lale, but that is where the similarities end. He talks about women like a teenager. Lale decides he can make this difference work for him and begins telling Baretski of his winning ways with girls, how it’s all about respecting them and what they care about.‘Have you ever given a girl flowers?’ asks Lale. ‘No, why would I do that?’‘Because they like a man who gives them flowers. Better still if you pick them yourself.’‘Well, I’m not gonna do that. I’d get laughed at.’‘By who?’‘My friends.’‘You mean other men?’‘Well, yeah – they’d think I was a sissy.’‘And what do you think the girl getting the flowers would think?’‘What does it matter what she thinks?’ He begins smirking and yanking at his groin. ‘That’s all I want from them, and that’s what they want from me. I know these things.’Lale walks ahead. Baretski catches up.‘What? Did I say something wrong?’‘Do you really want me to answer that?’‘Yeah.’Lale rounds on him. ‘Do you have a sister?’‘Yeah,’ says Baretski, ‘two.’‘Is how you treat a girl the way you want other men to treat your sisters?’ ‘Anyone does that to my kid sister and I’ll kill them.’ Baretski pulls hispistol from its holster and fires several shots into the air. ‘I’ll kill them.’39

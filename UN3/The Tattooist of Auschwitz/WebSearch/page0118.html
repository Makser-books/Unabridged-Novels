‘Oh, Jakub. I never imagined this would be the work they found for you. I’m so sorry.’‘If I must kill one Jew to save ten others, then I will.’Lale reaches his hand up to the large man’s shoulder. ‘Do what you have to.’‘Speak only in Yiddish,’ says Jakub, turning away. ‘I don’t think the SS here know you or that you speak German.’‘OK, Yiddish it is.’‘I’ll be here again later.’Back in darkness, Lale ponders his fate. He resolves to speak no names. It is now a matter of who kills him: a bored SS officer whose supper is getting cold, or Jakub, carrying out a just killing to save others.  A  sense of calm comes over him as he resigns himself to death.Will someone tell Gita what  happened  to him,  he  wonders, or  will she spend the rest of her life never knowing?Lale falls into a deep, exhausted sleep.•‘Where is he?’ his father roars, storming into the house.Once again Lale has not turned up to work. His father is late home for supper because he had to do Lale’s work for him. Lale runs and tries to hide behind his mother, pulling her away from the bench where she stands, putting a barrier between himself and his father. She reaches back and grabs hold of whatever part of Lale or his clothing she can, protecting him from what would otherwise be a cuff over the head at the least. His father doesn’t force her away or make any further attempt to reach Lale.‘I’ll deal with him,’ his mother says. ‘After dinner I’ll punish him. Now sit down.’Lale’s  brother  and  sister roll their  eyes.  They’ve  seen  and heard  it all before.Later that evening, Lale promises his mother he will try to be more helpful to his father. But it is so hard to help his father out. Lale fears he will end up like him, old before his time, too tired to pay his wife a simple compliment about her looks or the food she spends all day preparing for him. That is not who Lale wants to be.116

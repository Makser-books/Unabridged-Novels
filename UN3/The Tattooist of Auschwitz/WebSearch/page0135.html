children in his block being forced from the building. He watches until the last woman, clutching an infant, is shoved brutally out into the night. He follows them all outside and stands, stunned, as all around him the other Gypsy blocks are also emptied. Thousands of people are being herded onto nearby trucks. The compound is lit up and dozens of SS and their dogs corral the mob, shooting at anyone who doesn’t respond immediately to the instruction, ‘Get on the truck!’Lale stops a passing officer he recognises. ‘Where are you taking them?’ he asks.‘You want to join them, Tätowierer?’ the man responds, walking on.Lale sinks into the shadows, scanning the crowd. He sees Nadya and runs to her. ‘Nadya,’ he pleads. ‘Don’t go.’She forces a brave smile. ‘I don’t have a choice, Lale. I go where my people go. Goodbye, my friend, it’s been …’  An officer pushes her along before she can finish.Lale stands paralysed, watching until the last person has been loaded onto the trucks. The trucks drive off and slowly he walks back into the eerily silent block. He goes back to bed. Sleep will not come.•In the morning Lale, distraught, joins Leon and they work furiously as new transports arrive.Mengele is scanning the silent rows, making his way slowly towards the tattooists’ station. Leon’s hands tremble at his approach. Lale tries to give him a reassuring look. But the bastard who has mutilated him is only a few feet away. Mengele stops and watches them work. Occasionally he peers closely at a tattoo, increasing Lale and Leon’s agitation. His deathly smirk never leaves his face. He attempts eye contact with Lale, who never raises his eyes above the level of the arm he is working on.‘Tätowierer, Tätowierer,’  Mengele says, leaning over the table, ‘maybe today I will take you.’  He tilts his head, curiously, seeming to enjoy Lale’s discomfort. Then, having had his fun, he ambles away.Something light lands on Lale’s head and he looks up. Ash is belching from the nearby crematorium. He starts to tremble and drops his tattoo stick. Leon tries to steady him.‘Lale, what is it? What’s wrong?’Lale’s scream is choked by a sob. ‘You bastards, you fucking bastards!’133

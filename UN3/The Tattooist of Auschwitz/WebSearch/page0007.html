PrologueLale	tries	not	to	look	up.	He	reaches	out	to	take	the	piece	of	paper	beinghanded	to	him.	He	must	transfer	the	five	digits	onto	the	girl	who	holds	it.There	is	already	a	number	there	but	it	has	faded.	He	pushes	the	needle	intoher	left	arm,	making	a	3,	trying	to	be	gentle.	Blood	oozes.	But	the	needlehasn’t	gone	deep	enough	and	he	has	to	trace	the	number	again.	She	doesn’tflinch	at	the	pain	Lale	knows	he’s	inflicting.	They’ve	been	warned	–	saynothing,	do	nothing.	He	wipes	away	the	blood	and	rubs	green	ink	into	thewound.‘Hurry	up!’	Pepan	whispers.Lale	is	taking	too	long.	Tattooing	the	arms	of	men	is	one	thing;	defiling	thebodies	of	young	girls	is	horrifying.	Glancing	up,	Lale	sees	a	man	in	a	whitecoat	slowly	walking	up	the	row	of	girls.	Every	now	and	then	he	stops	toinspect	the	face	and	body	of	a	terrified	young	woman.	Eventually	he	reachesLale.	While	Lale	holds	the	girl’s	arm	as	gently	as	he	can,	the	man	takes	herface	in	his	hand	and	turns	it	roughly	this	way	and	that.	Lale	looks	up	into	thefrightened	eyes.	Her	lips	move	in	readiness	to	speak.	Lale	squeezes	her	armtightly	to	stop	her.	She	looks	at	him	and	he	mouths,	‘Shh.’	The	man	in	thewhite	coat	releases	her	face	and	walks	away.‘Well	done,’	he	whispers	as	he	sets	about	tattooing	the	remaining	fourdigits	–	4	9	0	2.	When	he	has	finished,	he	holds	on	to	her	arm	for	a	momentlonger	than	necessary,	looking	again	into	her	eyes.	He	forces	a	small	smile.She	returns	a	smaller	one.	Her	eyes,	however,	dance	before	him.	Looking	intothem	his	heart	seems	simultaneously	to	stop	and	begin	beating	for	the	firsttime,	pounding,	almost	threatening	to	burst	out	of	his	chest.	He	looks	down	atthe	ground	and	it	sways	beneath	him.	Another	piece	of	paper	is	thrust	at	him.‘Hurry	up,	Lale!’	Pepan	whispers	urgently.When	he	looks	up	again	she	is	gone.5

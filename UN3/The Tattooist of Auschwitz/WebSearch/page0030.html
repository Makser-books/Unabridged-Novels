He takes in the hundreds of new prisoners who are gathered there. Boys, young men, terror etched on each of their faces. Holding on to each other. Hugging themselves. SS and dogs shepherd them like lambs to the slaughter. They obey. Whether they live or die this day is about to be decided. Lale stops following Pepan and stands frozen. Pepan doubles back and guides him to some small tables with tattooing equipment on them. Those passing selection are moved into a line in front of their table. They will be marked. Other new arrivals – the old, infirm, no skills identified – are walking dead.A shot rings out. Men flinch. Someone falls. Lale looks in the direction of the shot, only for Pepan to grab his face and twist his head away.A  group of SS, mostly young, walk towards Pepan and Lale, guarding an older SS officer. Mid- to late forties, straight-backed in his immaculate uniform, his cap sitting precisely on his head – a perfect mannequin, thinks Lale, like those he occasionally helped dress when he worked in the department store in Bratislava.The SS stop in front of them. Pepan steps forward, acknowledging the officer with a bowed head as Lale watches.‘Oberscharführer Houstek, I have enlisted this prisoner to help.’ Pepan indicates Lale standing behind him.Houstek turns to Lale.Pepan continues. ‘I believe he will learn fast.’Houstek, steely-eyed, glares at Lale before wagging a finger for him to step forward. Lale does so.‘What languages do you speak?’‘Slovakian, German, Russian, French, Hungarian and a little Polish,’ Lale answers, looking him in the eye.‘Humph.’ Houstek walks away.Lale leans over and whispers to Pepan, ‘A man of few words. I take it I got the job?’Pepan turns on Lale, fire in his eyes and his voice, though he speaks quietly. ‘Do not underestimate him. Lose your bravado, or you will lose your life. Next time you talk to him, do not raise your eyes above the level of his boots.’‘I’m sorry,’ Lale says. ‘I won’t.’ When will I learn?28

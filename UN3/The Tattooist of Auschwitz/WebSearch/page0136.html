Leon grips Lale’s arm, trying to get him to control himself as Mengele looks their way and starts to walk back over. Lale is seeing red. He is out of control. Nadya. He tries desperately to rein himself in as Mengele arrives. He feels as though he might vomit.Mengele’s breath is in his face. ‘Is everything all right here?’‘Yes, Herr Doktor, everything is fine,’ Leon answers shakily.Leon bends down and picks up Lale’s stick.‘Just a broken stick. We’ll fix it and be right back to work,’ Leon continues.‘You  don’t look well, Tätowierer.  Would  you  like me to take  a  look at you?’ Mengele asks.‘I’m fine, just a broken stick,’ Lale coughs. He keeps his head down, turns away and tries to get back to work.‘Tätowierer!’ Mengele barks.Lale turns back towards Mengele, jaw clenched, head still low. Mengele has unholstered his pistol. He holds it limply at his side.‘I could have you shot for turning away from me.’  He raises the weapon, pointing it at Lale’s forehead. ‘Look at me. I could shoot you right now. What do you say to that?’Lale raises his head but moves his gaze to the doctor’s forehead, refusing to look into his eyes. ‘Yes, Herr Doktor. I’m sorry, it won’t happen again, Herr Doktor,’ he mutters.‘Get back to work.  You’re holding things up,’  Mengele barks, and again walks off. Lale looks at Leon and points to the ash now falling all around them.‘They emptied the Gypsy camp last night.’Leon hands Lale his tattoo stick, before going back to work himself, in silence. Lale looks up, searching for the sun to shine down on him. But it is concealed by ash and smoke.That evening he returns to his block, which is now occupied by people that he and Leon marked earlier. He shuts himself away in his room. He doesn’t want to make friends. Not tonight. Not ever. He wants only silence in his block.134

‘What  do you  mean,  hero?  She’s  not  a  hero,’ Gita  says,  with some annoyance. ‘She just wants to live.’‘And that makes her a hero. You’re a hero too, my darling. That the two of you have chosen to survive is a type of resistance to these Nazi bastards. Choosing to live is an act of defiance, a form of heroism.’‘In that case, what does it make you?’‘I have been given the choice of participating in the destruction of our people, and I have chosen to do so in order to survive. I can only hope I am not one day judged as a perpetrator or a collaborator.’Gita leans over and kisses him. ‘You are a hero to me.’Time has run on and they are startled when other girls start returning to the block. They are fully clothed and so Lale’s exit is not as embarrassing as it might otherwise have been.‘Hello. Hi. Dana, lovely to see you. Girls. Ladies,’ he says as he leaves.The kapo, in her normal position at the entrance to the building, shakes her head at Lale.‘You need to be out of here when the others return. OK, Tätowierer?’ ‘Sorry, won’t happen again.’Lale moves around the compound with half a spring in his step. He is surprised when he hears his name and looks around to see who is calling him. It is Victor. He and the other Polish workers are heading out of the camp. Victor summons him over.‘Hi Victor. Yuri. How are you doing?’‘Not as good as you by the look of it. What’s going on?’ Lale waves his hand. ‘Nothing, nothing.’‘We have supplies for you and thought we wouldn’t be able to hand them over. Have you got room in your bag?’‘Absolutely. Sorry, I should’ve come and seen you sooner, but I, er, was busy.’     Lale opens his bag and both Victor and Yuri fill it. There is too much to fit in.‘Do you want me to bring the rest back tomorrow?’ Victor asks.105

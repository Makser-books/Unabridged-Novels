‘Then you’d better get on with your work or you will be here all night,Tätowierer. And Herr Doktor won’t like that.’‘Leave  him, please.  Let  us  get  on  with  our  work.  I’m  sorry if  I’ve  done something to upset Herr Doktor,’ Lale says.The officer points his rifle at Lale. ‘Do you want to come too, Tätowierer?’ Leon says, ‘I’ll go. It’s OK, Lale. I’ll be back as soon as I can.’‘I’m sorry, Leon.’ Lale can no longer look at his friend.‘It’s all right. I’ll be all right. Get back to work.’Leon is marched off.•That evening Lale, greatly distressed, trudges alone, head down, back to Birkenau. Something just off the track catches his eye, a flash of colour. A flower, a single flower, waving in the breeze. Blood red petals around a jet black middle. He looks for others but there are none. Still, it is a flower, and he wonders again about the next time he could give flowers to someone he cares for. Images of Gita and his mother come to him, the two women he loves the most, floating just out of reach. Grief comes in waves, threatening to drown him.  Will the two ever meet?  Will the younger learn from the older?Will Mumma welcome and love Gita as I do?He had learned and practised the art of flirting on his mother. Though he was fairly sure she didn’t realise what he was doing, he knew; he knew what he was doing; he learned what worked on her and what didn’t, and he quickly worked out what was appropriate and inappropriate behaviour between a man and a woman. He suspected all young men embarked on this learning process with their mothers, though he often wondered if they consciously realised it. He had brought it up with several of his friends, who had reacted with shock, claiming they did no such thing. When he questioned them further about whether they got away with more from their mother than their father, they all admitted to behaviours that could be construed as flirting – they thought they were just getting around Mum because she was easier than Dad. Lale knew exactly what he was doing.Lale’s emotional connection to his mother had shaped the way he related to girls and women. He was attracted to all women, not just physically but emotionally. He loved talking to them; he loved making them feel good about themselves. To him, all women were beautiful and he believed there was no harm in telling them so. His mother and also his sister subliminally taught Lale what it was a woman wanted from a man, and so far he had spent his life trying to live up to these lessons. ‘Be attentive, Lale; remember the small things, and the big things will work themselves out.’ He heard his mother’s sweet voice.76

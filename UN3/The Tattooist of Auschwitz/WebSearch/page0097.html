He too has chosen to stay alive for as long as he can, by performing an act of defilement on people of his own faith. None of them meets his eye. He has heard what other prisoners say about these men and the privileged position they occupy – housed separately, receiving extra rations, having warm clothing and blankets to sleep under. Their lives parallel his and he feels a sinking in his gut at the thought that he too is despised for the role he plays at the camp. Unable to express in any way his solidarity with these men, he walks on.They are led to a large steel door. In front of it stands a guard.‘It’s all right, all the gas has gone. We need to send them to the ovens, but can’t until you identify the correct numbers.’The guard opens the door for Lale and Baretski. Pulling himself up to his full height, Lale looks Baretski in the eye and sweeps his hand from left to right.‘After you.’Baretski bursts out laughing and slaps Lale on the back, ‘No, after you.’ ‘No, after you,’ Lale repeats.‘I insist, Tätowierer.’The SS officer opens the doors wide and they step into a cavernous room. Bodies, hundreds of naked bodies, fill the room. They are piled up on each other, their limbs distorted. Dead eyes stare. Men, young and old; children at the bottom. Blood, vomit, urine and faeces. The smell of death pervades the entire space. Lale tries to holds his breath. His lungs burn. His legs threaten to give way beneath him. Behind him Baretski says, ‘Shit.’That one word from a sadist only deepens the well of inhumanity that Lale is drowning in.‘Over here,’ an officer indicates, and they follow him to a side of the room where two male bodies are laid out together. The officer starts talking to Baretski. For once words fail him, and he indicates that Lale can understand German.‘They both have the same number. How could that be?’ he asks.Lale can only shake his head and shrug his shoulders. How the hell should I know?‘Look at them. Which one is correct?’ the officer snaps.Lale leans down and takes hold of one of the arms. He is grateful for a reason to kneel and hopes it will stabilise him. He looks closely at the numbers tattooed on the arm he holds.95

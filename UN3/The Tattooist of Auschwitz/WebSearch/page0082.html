Lale smiles. A day that started badly is ending with a magnanimous gesture from a starving man.•The day of the game arrives. Lale wanders into the main compound to see SS painting a white line into what is far from an oblong shape. He hears his name being called and finds his ‘team’ gathered together. He joins the men.‘Hey, Lale, I’ve got fourteen players, counting you and me – a couple in reserve if some of us fall over,’ Big Joel tells him proudly.‘Sorry, I was told no substitutes. Just one team. Choose the fittest.’The men look at each other. Three hands rise, and those volunteering to take no part walk away. Lale watches as several of the men stretch and jump up and down in the manner of a professional warm-up.‘Some  of  these  guys  look  like  they  know  what  they  are  doing,’  Lale mutters to Little Joel.‘They should. Six of them have played semi-professionally.’‘You’re kidding!’‘Nope. We’re gonna kick their arses.’‘Little Joel, you can’t. We can’t win. I guess I didn’t make myself clear.’ ‘You said get a team together and I did.’‘Yeah,  but  we  can’t win.  We  can’t  do  anything to humiliate them.  We mustn’t tempt them to open fire on everyone. Look around you.’Little Joel sees the hundreds of prisoners gathered. There is an air of excitement in the camp, as they push and shove for a vantage point around the perimeter of the painted playing area. He sighs. ‘I’ll tell the others.’Lale scans the crowd for one face only. Gita stands with her friends and waves to him furtively. He waves back, wanting desperately to run to her, sweep her up in his arms and disappear behind the administration building. He hears loud banging and turns to see several SS pounding large poles into the ground at each end to make goalposts.Baretski approaches him. ‘Come with me.’At one end of the field, the crowd of prisoners parts as the SS team enters. None of them are in uniform. Several wear clothing that will make playing a game of football much easier. Shorts, singlets. Behind the team a heavily guarded Commandant Schwarzhuber and Lale’s boss, Houstek, approach Lale and Baretski.80

Chapter 21‘Are you sure you’re not a cat?’Lale hears the words and struggles to register where he is. He opens his eyes to find a grinning Baretski leaning over him.‘What?’‘You must be a cat, because you sure have more lives than anyone else here.’Lale struggles to sit up.‘It was …’‘Cilka, yes, I know. Must be nice to have friends in high places.’ ‘I’d gladly give my life for her not to need such friends.’‘You nearly did give your life. Not that it would’ve helped her.’ ‘Yeah, that’s one situation I can’t do anything about.’Baretski laughs. ‘You really think you run these camps, don’t you? Hell, maybe you do. You’re still alive and you shouldn’t be. How did you get out of Block 11?’‘I have no idea. When they took me out, I was sure I was headed for the Black Wall, but then I was thrown in a truck and brought back here.’‘I’ve never known anyone to walk away from the Strafkompanie, so well done,’ Baretski says.‘That’s one piece of history I don’t mind making. How come I’ve got my old room back?’‘Easy. It comes with the job.’ ‘What?’‘You’re the Tätowierer, and all I can say is, thank God. The eunuch who replaced you was no match.’‘Houstek is letting me have my job back?’‘I wouldn’t go anywhere near him. He didn’t want you back; he wanted you shot. It was Schwarzhuber who had other plans for you.’‘I need to get my hands on at least some chocolate for Cilka.’126

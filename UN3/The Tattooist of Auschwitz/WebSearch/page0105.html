‘Give me your arm.’As the boys look on, Lale sets about changing the number into a snake. The job isn’t perfect, but good enough to conceal the numbers.‘Why are you doing this?’ one of the boys asks.‘Where Mendel is going, no one is numbered. It wouldn’t take long for his number to be seen and then he would be right back here, to keep his appointment with the hangman.’He finishes the job and turns to the two boys looking on.‘You two get back to your block now, and go carefully. I’m only good for one rescue per night,’  he says. ‘Your friend won’t be here tomorrow. He’s going out on a transport at midnight. I don’t know where he’s going, but wherever it is he will have at least a chance of staying alive. Do you understand?’The three boys hug and make promises to catch up on the other side of this nightmare. When the friends have gone, Lale sits back down beside Mendel.‘You’ll stay here until it’s time to go. I’ll take you to the transport and then you’re on your own.’‘I don’t know how to thank you.’‘If you  manage to  escape  again, don’t get caught. That will  be  thanks enough for me.’A short while later Lale  hears  the telltale  sounds  of  movement in the compound.‘Come on, time to go.’Sneaking out, they edge along the walls of the building until they can see two trucks loading men.‘Move quickly and try to get in the middle of one of the lines. Push your way in and give them your name when asked.’Mendel hurries off and manages to get in a line. He wraps his arms around himself to ward off the cold, and to protect the snake he now bears. Lale watches as the guard finds his name and ushers him on board. As the engine starts up and the truck moves off, Lale slinks back to his room.103

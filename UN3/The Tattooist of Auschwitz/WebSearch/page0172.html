Author’s NoteI’m in the lounge of the home of an elderly man. I don’t know him well yet, but I’ve quickly come to know his dogs, Tootsie and Bam Bam – one the size of a pony and the other smaller than my cat. Thankfully I’ve won them over and right now they are asleep.I look away for a moment. I have to tell him. ‘You do know I’m not Jewish?’An hour has passed since we met. The elderly man in the chair opposite me gives an impatient but not unfriendly snort. He looks away, folds his fingers. His legs are crossed and the free foot raps a silent beat. His eyes look towards the window and the open space.‘Yes,’ he says finally, turning to me with a smile. ‘That’s why I want you.’ I relax a little. Maybe I am in the right place after all.‘So,’ he says, as though he is about to share a joke, ‘tell me what you know about Jews.’Seven-branch candlesticks come to mind as I scramble for something to say.‘Do you know any Jews?’I come up with one. ‘I work with a girl named Bella. She’s Jewish, I think.’ I expect disdain but instead receive enthusiasm. ‘Good!’ he says.I’ve passed another test.Next comes the first instruction. ‘You will have no preconceptions about what I tell you.’ He pauses, as though searching for words. ‘I don’t want any personal baggage brought to my story.’I shift uncomfortably. ‘Maybe there is some.’He leans forward, unsteady. He catches the table with a hand. The table is unsteady and its uneven leg smacks against the floor, causing an echo. The dogs wake up, startled.I swallow. ‘My mother’s maiden name was Schwartfeger. Her family were German.’He relaxes. ‘We all come from somewhere,’ he says.     ‘Yes, but I’m a Kiwi. My mother’s family have lived in New Zealand for over a hundred years.’170

‘Oh, I’ll have the diamond, thank you,’ she says, playing along.Lale rummages  around  in his  bag and produces an  exquisite silver ring with a single diamond set in it. Handing it to her, he says, ‘It’s yours.’Gita can’t take her eyes off the ring, the sun bouncing off the stone. ‘Where did you get this?’‘Girls working in one of the Canada buildings find jewels and money for me. That’s what I use to buy the food and medicine I’ve been giving you and the others. Here, take it.’Gita puts her hand out as though to try on the ring, but then pulls back. ‘No, you keep it. Put it to good use.’‘OK.’ Lale goes to put it back in his bag.‘Stop. Let me look at it one more time.’He holds it between two fingers, turning it this way and that. ‘It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Now put it away.’‘It’s the second most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,’ says Lale, looking at Gita. She blushes and turns her face away.‘I’ll have some more of that chocolate, if you have any left.’Lale hands her a small block. She snaps off a piece and places it in her mouth, closing her eyes for a moment. She wraps the rest within her sleeve and tucks it up.‘Come on,’ he says. ‘Let’s get you back to the girls so you can share it.’ Gita reaches up to his face, caresses his cheek. ‘Thank you.’Lale sways, unbalanced by her proximity.Gita takes his hand and begins to walk. Lale is led. As they enter the main compound, Lale sees Baretski. He and Gita release hands. He exchanges a glance with her that tells her all she needs to know. It aches to part from her without a word, and with no certainty about when they will next meet. He walks towards Baretski, who is glaring at him.‘I’ve  been looking  for  you,’  says  Baretski.  ‘We’ve  got  work  to do  at Auschwitz.’•Along the road to Auschwitz, Lale and Baretski pass work details, of a few men each, who must be being punished with this Sunday work. Several SS guarding them call out a greeting to Baretski, who ignores them. 65

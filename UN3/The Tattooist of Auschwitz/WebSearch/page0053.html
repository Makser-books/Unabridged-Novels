‘No, he hasn’t.’  says Victor. ‘Lale, take the sausage, and come and see us again tomorrow. I’ll have more for you. Hell, if we can help just one of you, we’ll do it. Right, Yuri?’Yuri reluctantly extends his hand to Lale, who takes it.‘Save the one, save the world,’ Lale says quietly, more to himself than the others.‘I can’t help you all.’Lale takes the food. ‘I don’t have anything to pay you with.’ ‘It’s not a problem.’‘Thank you. There might be a way I can pay you though. If I find a way, can you get me anything else, like chocolate?’  He wanted chocolate. That’s what you give a girl if you can get it.‘I’m sure we can work something out. You’d better move on; there’s an officer paying us a bit of attention.’‘See you,’ Lale says as he shoves the sausage in his bag. Stray snowflakes drift around him as he walks back to his block. The flakes catch in the last rays of the sun, bouncing strobes of light that remind him of a kaleidoscope he played with as a boy. What’s wrong with this picture?  Lale is overcome with emotion as he hurries back to his block. On his face the melted snow is indistinguishable from the tears. The winter of 1942 has arrived.•Back in his room, Lale takes the chunk of sausage and breaks it carefully into even parts. He tears strips from the wax-paper and wraps each piece tightly before placing them back in his bag. As he comes to the last piece, Lale stops and considers the small, fulfilling parcel of food, sitting there next to his rough, dirty fingers. These fingers that used to be smooth and clean and plump, that handled rich food, that he used to hold up to tell hosts, ‘No, thank you, I couldn’t possibly have any more.’ With a shake of his head he places it too into the bag.He heads towards one of the Canada buildings. He once asked a man in Block 7 if he knew why they called these sorting rooms by that name.‘The girls who work there dream of a place far away where there is plenty of everything and life can be what they want it to be. They have decided Canada is such a place.’Lale  has spoken  to  a  couple  of  girls working in this Canada.  He  has checked everyone  exiting many times  and knows  Gita doesn’t  work  here.51

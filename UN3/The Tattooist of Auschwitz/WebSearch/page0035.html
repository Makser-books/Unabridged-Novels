‘The process will go much faster, you know, if I have an assistant.’The SS officer takes a step closer to Lale, looking him up and down with contempt.‘What?’‘If you get someone to help me, the process will go faster and your boss will be happy.’As if instructed by Houstek, the officer turns away and walks down the line of young men waiting to be numbered, all of whom, bar one, have their heads bowed. Lale fears for the one staring back at the officer and is surprised when he is dragged by the arm and marched up to Lale.‘Your assistant. Do his number first.’Lale takes the piece of paper from the young man and quickly tattoos his arm.‘What’s your name?’ he asks. ‘Leon.’‘Leon, I am Lale, the Tätowierer,’  he says, his voice firm like Pepan’s. ‘Now, stand beside me and watch what I’m doing. Starting tomorrow, you will work for me as my assistant. It might just save your life.’•The sun has set by the time the last prisoner has been tattooed and shoved towards his new home. Lale’s guard, whose name, he found out, is Baretski, didn’t wander more than a few metres from him. He approaches Lale and his new assistant.‘Take him to your block, then come back here.’ Lale hurries Leon to Block 7.‘Wait outside the block in the morning and I’ll come and get you. If your kapo wants to know why you aren’t going with the others to build, tell him you now work for the Tätowierer.’•When Lale returns to his workstation, his tools have been packed into an attaché bag and his table has been folded. Baretski stands waiting for him.‘Bring these to your new room. Each morning, report to the administration building for supplies and to get instructions on where you will be working that day.’33

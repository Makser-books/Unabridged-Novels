Lale steps in front of the animal, forcing the man to rein it in.‘I’d like to buy your horse and cart,’ he blurts out. ‘How much?’Lale pulls several gems from his pocket. ‘They are real. And worth a lot of money.’After inspecting the treasure, the old man says, ‘On one condition.’ ‘What? Anything.’‘You have to take me home first.’A short while later Lale pulls  up  outside his sister’s house and  proudly shows off his new means of transport.‘I haven’t got anything for him to eat,’ she exclaims.He points to the long grass. ‘Your front yard needs mowing.’That night, with the horse tethered in the front yard, Mrs Molnar and Goldie set about making meals for Lale to take on his journey. He hates saying goodbye to them both so soon after arriving home, but they won’t hear of him staying.‘Don’t come back without Gita,’  are the last words Goldie says as Lale climbs into the back of the cart and is nearly thrown out by the horse taking off. He looks back at the two women standing outside his family home, each with an arm around the other, smiling, waving.•For three days and nights Lale and his new companion travel down broken roads and through bombed-out towns. They ford streams where bridges have been destroyed. They give lifts to various people along the way. Lale eats sparingly from his rations. He feels profound grief for his scattered family. At the same time, he longs for Gita, and this gives him the sense of purpose he needs to carry on. He must find her. He has promised.When he eventually arrives back in Bratislava he goes immediately to the train station. ‘Is it true that survivors from the concentration camps have been coming home?’ he asks. He is told it is and is given the train schedule. With no idea where Gita might have ended up – not even which country – he decides the only thing to do is meet every train. He thinks about finding somewhere to stay, but a strange man and a horse is not an attractive proposition as a lodger, so he sleeps in his cart in whatever spot of vacant land he can find, for as long as it takes for the horse to eat the grass or for them to be moved along.166

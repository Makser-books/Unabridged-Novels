The tops of the fences are lined with razor wire. Up in the lookouts Lale sees SS pointing rifles in his direction. Lightning hits a fence nearby.  They are electrified. The thunder is not loud enough to drown out the sound of a shot, another man fallen.‘We made it.’Lale turns to see Aron pushing his way towards him. Drenched, bedraggled. But alive.‘Yeah, looks like we’re home. You look a sight.’‘You haven’t seen yourself. Consider me a mirror.’‘No thanks.’‘What happens now?’ says Aron, sounding like a child.•Going with the steady flow of men, they each show their tattooed arm to an SS officer standing outside a building, who records the number on a clipboard. After a forceful shove in the back, Lale and Aron find themselves in Block 7, a large hut with triple bunks down one wall. Dozens of men are forced into the building. They scramble and shove each other out of the way to lay claim to a space. If they are lucky or aggressive enough they might share with only one or two others. Luck isn’t on Lale’s side. He and Aron climb up onto a top-level bunk, already occupied by two other prisoners. Having had no food for days, there isn’t much fight left in them. As best he can, Lale curls up onto the straw-filled sack that passes for a mattress. He pushes his hands against his stomach in an attempt to quell the cramps invading his guts. Several men call out to their guards, ‘We need food.’The reply comes back: ‘You’ll get something in the morning.’‘We’ll all be dead from starvation by morning,’ says someone in the back of the block.‘And at peace,’ a hollow voice adds.‘These mattresses have got hay in them,’ someone else says. ‘Maybe we should continue to act like cattle and eat that.’Snatches of quiet laughter. No response from the officer.And then, from deep in the dormitory, a hesitant, ‘Mooooooo …’Laughter. Quiet, but real. The officer, present but invisible, doesn’t interrupt, and eventually the men fall asleep, stomachs rumbling.•14

He takes his pistol from its holster and pushes it hard against Gita’s temple. He gives the instruction to another officer: ‘No food for them today.’As he walks away, their kapo advances and slaps them both quickly across the face. ‘Don’t forget where you are.’  She walks away and Gita rests her head on Dana’s shoulder.‘I told you Lale’s going to talk to me next Sunday, didn’t I?’•Sunday. Prisoners meander around the compound singly and in small groups. Some sit up against the buildings, too tired and weak to move. A handful of SS roam about chatting and smoking, ignoring the prisoners. Gita and her friends walk around, keeping their faces blank. All but Gita talk quietly. She is looking about her.Lale watches Gita and her friends, smiling at Gita’s worried look. Whenever her eyes almost land on him, he ducks behind other prisoners. He moves slowly towards her. Dana sees him first and is about to say something when Lale holds a finger to his lips. Without breaking step, he reaches out, takes Gita by the hand and continues walking. Her friends giggle and grasp each other as Lale silently steers Gita around the back of the administration building, checking to make sure the guard in the nearby tower is relaxed and not looking in their direction.He slides his back down the wall of the building, pulling Gita with him. From there they can see the forest beyond the perimeter fence. Gita peers down at the ground while Lale looks intently at her.‘Hello …’ he says tentatively.‘Hello,’ she replies.‘I hope I haven’t frightened you.’‘Are we safe?’ She darts a look at the nearby guard tower.‘Probably not, but I can’t go on just seeing you. I need to be with you and talk to you like people should.’‘But we’re not safe –’‘It’s never going to be safe. Talk to me. I want to hear your voice. I want to know all about you. All I know is your name. Gita. It’s beautiful.’‘What do you want me to say?’Lale struggles for the right question. He goes for something ordinary. ‘How about … How’s your day been?’46

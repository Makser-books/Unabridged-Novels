Lale  jumps  back.  The  gunshots  reverberate  around  them.  Baretski  is panting, his face red and his eyes dark.Lale raises his hands. ‘Got it. Just something to think about.’ ‘I don’t want to talk about this anymore.’•Lale finds out that Baretski isn’t German but was born in Romania, in a small town near the border of Slovakia, only a few hundred kilometres from Lale’s hometown of Krompachy. He ran away from home to Berlin, joined the Hitler Youth and then the SS. He hates his father, who used to beat him and his brothers and sisters viciously. He is still worried about his sisters, one younger, one older, who live at home.Later that night as they walk back to Birkenau, Lale says quietly, ‘I’ll take your offer of pen and pencil if you don’t mind. Her number is 34902.’After dinner, Lale slips quietly over to Block 7. The kapo glares at him but says nothing.Lale shares his extra evening rations, only a few crusts of bread, with his friends from the block. The men talk and exchange news. As usual, the religious among them invite Lale to partake in evening prayer. He politely declines and his refusal is politely accepted. This is the standard routine.•Alone in his single room, Lale wakes to the sight of Baretski standing over him. He didn’t knock before entering – he never has – but there is something different about this visit.‘She’s in Block 29.’ He hands Lale a pencil and some paper. ‘Here, write to her and I will make sure she gets it.’‘Do you know her name?’Baretski’s look gives Lale his answer. What do you think? ‘I’ll come back in an hour and take it to her.’‘Make it two.’Lale agonises over the first words he will write to prisoner 34902. How to even begin? How to address her?  Eventually he decides to keep it simple, ‘Hello, my name is Lale.’ When Baretski returns, he hands him the page with only a few sentences on it. He has told her he is from Krompachy in Slovakia, his age, and the make-up of his family, who he trusts are safe. 40

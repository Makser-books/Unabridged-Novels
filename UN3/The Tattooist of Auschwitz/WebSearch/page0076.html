Chapter 11May 1943Lale and Leon’s daily lives are still being dictated by the arrival of transports from across Europe. As spring becomes summer, they do not stop coming.Today the pair are working with long rows of female prisoners. The selection process is taking place a small distance away. They are too busy to pay attention to it. An arm and a piece of paper appear before them, and they do their job. Over and again. These prisoners are unusually quiet, perhaps sensing evil in the air. Lale suddenly hears someone break into whistling. The tune is familiar, perhaps an opera. The whistling grows louder and Lale glances in its direction. A man in a white coat is walking their way. Lale puts his head down, attempting to keep to the rhythm of his job.  Don’t look at faces. He takes the paper, makes the number, the way he has a thousand times before.The whistling stops. The doctor now stands beside Lale, emitting a pungent smell of disinfectant. Leaning over, he inspects Lale’s work and takes the arm he is midway through tattooing. He must be satisfied because he moves on as quickly as he arrived, bastardising another melody. Lale looks up at Leon, who has turned pale. Baretski materialises beside them.‘What do you think of our new doctor?’‘Didn’t really introduce himself,’ murmurs Lale.Baretski laughs. ‘This is one doctor you don’t want to be introduced to, trust me. I’m scared of him. The guy’s a creep.’‘Do you know what he’s called?’‘Mengele, Herr Doktor Josef Mengele. You should remember that name, Tätowierer.’‘What was he doing at the selection?’‘Herr Doktor has made it known that he will be at many of the selections, as he is looking for particular patients.’‘I take it being sick is not a criterion for him.’Baretski doubles  over  laughing. ‘You can be so funny  sometimes, Tätowierer.’•74

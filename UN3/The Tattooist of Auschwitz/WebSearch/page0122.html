Chapter 20Lale is helped from the truck  and dragged  into  Oberscharführer  Houstek’s office. The two SS officers hold him by an arm each.‘We got nothing out of him even after the big Jew had a go,’ one of them says.Houstek turns to Lale, who raises his head.‘So you really didn’t know their names? And they didn’t shoot you?’ ‘No, sir.’‘Returned you to me, hey? Now you’re my problem again.’‘Yes, sir.’Houstek addresses the officers.‘Take him to Block 31.’ He turns to Lale. ‘We will get some hard work out of you before your number is up, mark my words.’Lale is dragged from the office. He tries to keep pace with the SS officers. But halfway across the compound he gives up and sacrifices the skin on the top of his feet to the gravel. The officers open the door to Block 31 and toss him inside before taking their leave. Lale lies on the floor, exhausted in body and soul. Several inmates approach him cautiously. Two try to help him up, but Lale cries out in pain and they stop. One of the men pulls up Lale’s shirt, revealing the large welts across his back and buttocks. More gently this time they pick him up and place him on a bunk. He soon falls asleep.•‘I know who this is,’ one of the prisoners says.‘Who?’ another asks.‘It’s  the Tätowierer.  Don’t  you  recognise him?  He  probably made your number.’‘Yeah, you’re right. I wonder who he pissed off.’‘I  got extra rations from him  when  I was  in Block  6.  He was  always handing out food.’‘I don’t know about that. I’ve only been in this block. I pissed someone off the day I arrived.’ The men chuckle quietly.‘He can’t make it to supper. I’ll bring him some of mine. He’s gonna need120

Chapter 15Lale walks determinedly from his block and across the compound.  Two SS officers approach him, rifles at the ready. Without breaking step, he holds up his bag.‘Politische Abteilung!’The rifles lower and he passes without another word. Lale enters the women’s camp and heads immediately to Block 29, where he is met by the kapo, who leans against the building, looking bored. Her charges are away working. She doesn’t bother to move as he approaches her and takes from his bag a large block of chocolate. Having been warned by Baretski not to interfere in the relationship between the Tätowierer and prisoner 34902, she accepts the bribe.‘Please bring Gita to me. I’ll wait inside.’Stuffing the chocolate down her ample bosom and shrugging her shoulders, the kapo sets off to the administration building. Lale goes inside the barracks block, shutting the door behind him. He doesn’t have to wait long. A flash of sunlight – the door opens – tells him she has arrived. Gita sees him standing in the semi-dark, his head bowed.‘You!’Lale takes a step towards her. She steps back, hard up against the shut door, clearly distressed.‘Are you all right? Gita, it’s me.’He takes one step closer, and is shocked by her visible trembling. ‘Say something, Gita.’‘You … you …’ she repeats.‘Yes, it’s me, Lale.’ He takes hold of her two wrists and tries to hold them tightly.‘Have you any idea what goes through your head when the SS come for you? Any idea at all?’     ‘Gita …’     ‘How could you? How could you let the SS take me?’     Lale is dumbfounded.  He relaxes  his grip on her wrists and she  pulls free and turns away.97

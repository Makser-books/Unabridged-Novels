are being shuttled up to them. The two men move aside as Lale clambers up. The roof consists only of wooden beams for supporting the tiles.‘Be careful,’ one of the workmen warns him. ‘Move further up the roofline and watch us. It’s not difficult – you’ll soon get the hang of it.’  The man is Russian.‘My name’s Lale.’‘Introductions later, OK?’ The two men exchange a look. ‘You understand me?’‘Yes,’ Lale replies in Russian. The men smile.Lale watches as they receive the heavy clay tiles from the pair of hands poking over the lip of the roof, crawl to where the last tiles were laid and carefully overlap them, before moving back to the ladder for the next one. The Russian had been correct – it’s not difficult work – and it isn’t long before Lale joins them in accepting and laying the tiles. On the warm spring day only the hunger pains and cramps prevent him from matching the more experienced workers.A few hours pass before they are permitted to take a break. Lale heads for the ladder but the Russian stops him.‘It’s safer to stay up here and rest. You can’t be seen well this high up.’Lale follows the men, who clearly know the best place to sit and stretch out: the corner where stronger timber was used to reinforce the roof.‘How long have you been here?’ Lale asks as soon as they settle down. ‘About two months, I think. Hard to tell after a while.’‘Where did you come from? I mean, how did you end up here? Are you Jewish?’‘One question at a time.’  The Russian chuckles and the younger, larger worker rolls his eyes at the ignorance of the newcomer, yet to learn his place in the camp.‘We’re not Jewish, we are Russian soldiers. We got separated from our unit and the fucking Germans caught us and put us to work. What about you? A Jew?’‘Yes. I’m part of a large group brought in yesterday from Slovakia – all Jews.’The Russians exchange a glance. The older man turns away, closing his eyes, raising his face to the sun, leaving it to his companion to continue the conversation.19

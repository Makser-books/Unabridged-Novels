it tomorrow.’A short while later Lale is woken by two men, each with a small piece of bread. They offer it to him and he gratefully accepts.‘I’ve got to get out of here.’ The men laugh.‘Sure, my friend. You have two options then: one is quick, the other might take a little longer.’‘And what are they?’‘Well, tomorrow morning you can go outside and throw yourself on the death cart when it comes around. Or you can come and work in the fields with us until you drop or beg them to shoot you.’‘I don’t like those options. I’ll have to find another way.’‘Good luck, my friend. You’d better get some rest. You’ve got a long day ahead of you, especially in your condition.’•That night, Lale dreams of his departures from home.The first time he’d left home he was a young man full of promise, in search of a future to make his own. He would find a job he enjoyed and could grow in. He would have rich experiences, visiting the romantic cities of Europe that he’d read about in books: Paris, Rome, Vienna. Above all, he wanted to find that one person he would fall in love with, shower with affection and the things his mother had said were important: flowers, chocolates, his time and attention.His  second  departure, full  of  uncertainty  and  the  unknown,  rattled him. What lay ahead?He arrived in Prague after a long, emotionally painful journey away from his family. He reported as instructed to the relevant government department and was told to find accommodation nearby and to report back weekly until his role was decided. On 16 April, a month later, he was told to report with his belongings to a local school. There he was housed with a number of young Jewish men from across Slovakia.Lale prided himself on his appearance, and his living situation did not prevent him from looking his best. Each day he washed and cleaned his clothes in the school toilet block. He didn’t know where he was headed but wanted to make damned sure he looked his best when he arrived.121

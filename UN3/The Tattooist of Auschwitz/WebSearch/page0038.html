Baretski snorts beside Lale. ‘It’s true, with that bag and those words you are safe, except from me of course. Screw up and get me into trouble and no bag or words will save you.’ His hand goes to his pistol, rests on the holster, flicks the catch open. Closed. Open. Closed. His breathing grows deeper.Lale does the smart thing, lowers his eyes and turns away.•Transports come into Auschwitz-Birkenau at all times of the day and night. It isn’t unusual for Lale and Leon to work around the clock. On such days Baretski shows his most unpleasant side. He screams abuse or beats Leon, blaming him for keeping him from his bed with his slowness. Lale quickly learns that the bad treatment gets worse if he tries to prevent it.Finishing up in the early hours of one morning at Auschwitz, Baretski turns to walk away before Lale and Leon have packed up. Then he turns back, a look of indecision on his face.‘Oh fuck it, you two can walk back to Birkenau on your own. I’m sleeping here tonight. Just be back here at eight in the morning.’‘How are we meant to know what the time is?’ Lale asks.‘I don’t give a fuck how you do it, just be here. And don’t even think about running away. I’ll hunt you down myself, kill you and enjoy it.’ He staggers off.‘What do we do?’ Leon asks.‘What the arsehole told us to. Come on – I’ll get you up in time to make it back here.’‘I’m so tired. Can’t we stay here?’‘No. If you’re not seen in your block in the morning they’ll be out looking for you. Come on, let’s get going.’•Lale rises with the sun, and he and Leon make the four-kilometre trek back to Auschwitz. They wait for what seems like an hour until Baretski shows up. It is obvious he didn’t go straight to bed but has been up drinking. When his breath is foul, his temper is worse.‘Get moving,’ he bellows.With no sign of new prisoners, Lale has to reluctantly ask the question, ‘To where?’‘Back to Birkenau. The transports have dropped the latest lot there.’36

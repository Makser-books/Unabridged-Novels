‘I’m your favourite, aren’t I, Mumma?’ Lale would ask. If the two of them were alone in the house, his mother would hug him tightly. ‘Yes, my darling, you are.’ If his brother or sister were present, ‘You are all my favourites.’ Lale never heard his brother or sister ask this question, but they might have in his absence. When he was a young boy, he would often announce to his family that he was going to marry his mother when he grew up. His father would pretend not to hear. His siblings would goad Lale into a fight, pointing out that their mother was already married. After breaking up their fights his mother would take him aside and explain to him that he would find someone else one day to love and care for. He never wanted to believe her.As he became a young man he would run home to his mother each day for the hugged greeting, the feel of her comforting body, her soft skin, the kisses she planted on his forehead.‘What can I do to help you?’ he would say.‘You’re such a good boy. You will make someone a wonderful husband one day.’‘Tell me what to do to be a good husband. I don’t want to be like Papa. He doesn’t make you smile. He doesn’t help you.’‘Your papa works very hard to earn money for us to live.’‘I know, but can’t he do both? Earn money and make you smile?’‘You have a lot to learn before you grow up, young man.’‘Then teach me. I want the girl I marry to like me, to be happy with me.’Lale’s mother sat down, and he took a seat across from her. ‘You must first learn to listen to her. Even if you are tired, never be too tired to listen to what she has to say. Learn what she likes, and more importantly what she doesn’t like. When you can, give her little treats – flowers, chocolates – women like these things.’‘When was the last time Papa brought you a treat?’‘It doesn’t matter. You want to know what girls want, not what I get.’ ‘When I’ve got money, I’ll bring you flowers and chocolates, I promise.’ ‘You should save your money for the girl who captures your heart.’‘How will I know who she is?’‘Oh, you’ll know.’She drew him into her arms and stroked his hair: her boy, her young man.117

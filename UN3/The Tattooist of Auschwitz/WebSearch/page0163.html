The next morning Lale showers and dresses in his chosen clothes, including four pairs of underpants and three pairs of socks. He puts the sock containing the gems into his inside jacket pocket. He takes one last look around his room and then makes his way to the vault. Lale helps himself to his normal amount of money and jewels and is about to leave when the accountant officer stops him.‘Wait. Take extra today. We have two very senior officers from Moscow arriving this afternoon. Buy them the best.’Lale takes the extra money and jewels. ‘I might be a little bit late back this morning. I’m going to the library as well to see if I can borrow a book.’‘We’ve got a perfectly good library here.’‘Thanks, but there are always officers in there, and … well, I still find them intimidating. You understand?’‘Oh, OK. As you wish.’Lale walks into the garage and nods to the attendant, who is busy washing a car. ‘Lovely day, Lale. Keys are in the jeep. I hear you’re going alone today.’‘Yes, Fredrich’s been transferred; sure hope it isn’t to the front.’ The attendant laughs. ‘Just be his rotten luck.’‘Oh, I’ve got permission to be back later than usual today.’‘Want a bit of action for yourself, do you?’‘Something like that. See you later.’‘OK, have a good day.’Lale hops casually into the jeep and drives away from the chalet without looking back. In the village, he parks at the end of the main street, leaves the keys in the ignition and walks away. He spots a bicycle leaning outside a shop, which he casually wheels away. Then he hops on and cycles out of town.A few kilometres away he is stopped by a Russian patrol. A young officer challenges him. ‘Where are you going?’‘I have been a prisoner of the Germans for three years. I am from Slovakia and I am going home.’The Russian grabs hold of the handlebars, forcing Lale to dismount. He turns away from him and receives a firm kick up the bum.161

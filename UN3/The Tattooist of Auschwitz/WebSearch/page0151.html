He chats to amenable guards and tries to understand the dynamic among the prisoners. Once he discovers that he is probably the only Slovakian prisoner here, he decides to keep to himself. Poles, Russians and a few Italians sit around all day talking with their countrymen, leaving Lale largely isolated.One  day,  two  young  men sidle  up  to him. ‘They  say you  were  the Tätowierer at Auschwitz.’‘Who are “they”?’‘Someone said they thought they knew you there and that you tattooed the prisoners.’Lale grabs the young man’s hand and pulls up his sleeve. No number. He turns to the second man.‘What about you, were you there?’ ‘No, but is it true what they say?’ ‘I was the Tätowierer, but so what?’ ‘Nothing. Just asking.’The boys walk away. Lale goes back to his daydreaming. He doesn’t see the approaching SS officers until they yank him to his feet and frogmarch him to a nearby building. Lale finds himself standing in front of the ageing commandant, who nods to one of the SS officers. The officer pulls up Lale’s sleeve, revealing his number.‘You were in Auschwitz?’ the commandant asks. ‘Yes, sir.’‘Were you the Tätowierer there?’‘Yes, sir.’‘So you are a Jew?’‘No, sir, I am a Catholic.’The commandant raises a brow. ‘Oh? I didn’t know they had Catholics in Auschwitz.’‘They had all religions there, sir, along with criminals and politicals.’ ‘Are you a criminal?’‘No, sir.’‘And you’re not a Jew?’‘No, sir. I’m Catholic.’149

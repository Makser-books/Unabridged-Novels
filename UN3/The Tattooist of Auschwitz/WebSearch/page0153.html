Chapter 27Lale wakes to the feeling of the sun on his face. His clothes have dried out a bit and he can hear the sound of the river running below him. He crawls on his belly through the trees that have hidden him overnight and reaches the crest of a road. Russian soldiers are walking along it. He watches for a few moments, fearing gunfire. But the soldiers are relaxed. He decides to accelerate his plan to get home.Lale  raises  his  hands  and  steps  out  onto  the  road,  startling  a  group  of soldiers. They raise their rifles immediately.‘I am Slovakian. I have been in a concentration camp for three years.’ The soldiers exchange glances.‘Fuck off,’  one of them says, and they resume their march, one of them shoving Lale as he goes by. He stands for several minutes as many more soldiers walk past, ignoring him. Accepting their indifference, he carries on, receiving only an occasional glance. He decides to walk in the opposite direction to them, reasoning that the Russians are probably heading to engage with the Germans, so getting as far away as possible makes sense.Eventually a jeep pulls up alongside him and stops. An officer in the back eyeballs him. ‘Who the hell are you?’‘I’m Slovakian. I have been a prisoner in Auschwitz for three years.’ He pulls up his left sleeve to reveal his tattooed number.‘Never heard of it.’Lale swallows. It is unimaginable to him that a place of such horror should not be known.‘It’s in Poland. That’s all I can tell you.’‘You speak perfect Russian,’ the soldier says. ‘Any other languages?’ ‘Czech, German, French, Hungarian and Polish.’The officer  eyes  him more carefully. ‘And where do you  think you’re going?’‘Home, back to Slovakia.’‘No, you’re not. I have just the job for you. Get in.’Lale wants to run, but he would have no chance, so he climbs into the passenger seat.151

His minder laughs. ‘Yes, we  have.  This headquarters is  a  bit more comfortable than the one we had at the front.’‘Are you going to tell me where I fit in?’‘This is Fredrich. He is going to be your guard. He will shoot you if you try to escape.’Lale looks at the man. His arm muscles bulge against his shirtsleeves and his chest threatens to pop the buttons that hold it in. His thin lips neither smile nor grimace. Lale’s nod of greeting isn’t returned.‘He will not only guard you here but will take you to the village each day to make our purchases. Do you understand?’‘What am I buying?’‘Well, it’s not wine; we have a cellar full of that. Food, the chefs will buy. They know what they want …’‘So that leaves …’‘Entertainment.’Lale keeps his face neutral.‘You  will  go  into the village each morning to find lovely  young  ladies interested in spending some time here with us in the evening. Understand?’‘I’m to be your pimp?’‘You understand perfectly.’‘How am I to persuade them? Tell them you are all good-looking fellows who will treat them well?’‘We will give you things to entice them.’ ‘What sort of things?’‘Come with me.’The three men walk back downstairs to another sumptuous room, where an officer opens a large vault set into a wall. The minder enters the vault and brings out two metal tins, which he places on the desk. In one there is currency, in the other, jewellery. Lale can see many other similar tins shelved in the vault.‘Fredrich will bring you here each morning and you will take both money and jewellery for the girls. We need eight to ten each night. Just show them the payment and if need be, give them a small amount of money in advance. Tell them they will be paid in full when they arrive at the chalet, and when the evening is over they will be returned to their homes safe and well.’154

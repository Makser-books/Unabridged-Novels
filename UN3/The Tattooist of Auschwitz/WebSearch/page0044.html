He needs to read the words buried among his tools.He drops onto his bed and holds the note to his chest, picturing prisoner 34902 writing the words he is so eager to read. Finally, he opens it.‘Dear Lale,’ it begins. Like him, the woman has written only a few careful lines. She is also from Slovakia. She has been in Auschwitz longer than Lale, since March. She works in one of the ‘Canada’  warehouses, where prisoners sort through the confiscated belongings of fellow victims. She will be in the compound on Sunday. And will look for him. Lale rereads the note and turns the paper over several times. Grabbing a pencil from his bag he scribbles in bold on the back of her letter: Your name, what is your name?•The next morning, Baretski escorts Lale to Auschwitz alone. The new transport is a small one, giving Leon a day’s rest. Baretski begins to tease Lale about the note and how he must have lost his touch with the ladies. Lale ignores his teasing, asks him if he’s read any good books lately.‘Books? I don’t read books,’ Baretski mutters. ‘You should.’‘Why? What good are books?’‘You can learn a lot from them, and girls like it if you can quote lines or recite poetry.’‘I don’t need to quote books. I’ve got this uniform; that’s all I need to get girls. They love the uniform. I have a girlfriend, you know,’ Baretski boasts.This is news to Lale.‘That’s nice. And she likes your uniform?’‘Sure does. She even puts it on and marches around saluting – thinks she’s bloody Hitler.’  With a chilling laugh he mimics her, strutting away, arm raised, ‘Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!’‘Just because she likes your uniform doesn’t mean to say she likes you,’ blurts out Lale.Baretski stops in his tracks.Lale curses himself for the careless comment. He slows his steps, pondering whether to go back and apologise. No, he’ll walk on and see what happens. Closing his eyes, he places one foot in front of the other, one step at a time, waiting, expecting to hear the shot. He hears the sound of running behind him. Then the tug of an arm on his sleeve. ‘Is that what you think,42

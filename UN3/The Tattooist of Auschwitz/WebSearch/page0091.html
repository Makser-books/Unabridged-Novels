‘Can I ask a favour?’‘You can ask,’ says Baretski.‘If I write a note to Gita telling her I’m OK and just busy at Auschwitz, will you get it to her?’‘I’ll do better. I’ll tell her myself.’ ‘Thank you.’Although Lale and a select group of prisoners do receive some extra rations for a few days, they soon dry up and Lale is unsure if the Red Cross ever did enter the camp. Baretski is more than capable of making up the whole idea. Lale has to trust that his message to Gita will be conveyed –though he doesn’t trust Baretski to do that straightforwardly either. He can only wait and hope that a Sunday when he doesn’t have to work will arrive soon.•Finally the day comes when Lale finishes work early. He races between the camps and gets to the Birkenau administration building just as the workers are leaving. Impatiently, he waits. Why does she have to be one of the last ones out today? At last she appears. Lale’s heart leaps. He wastes no time grabbing her by the arm and taking her to the back of the building. She trembles as he pushes her up against the wall.‘I  thought  you were dead. I  thought  I’d  never see you  again.  I  …’ she stammers.He  runs  his  hands  along  her face.  ‘Did  you  not get my message from Baretski?’‘No. I got no message from anyone.’‘Shh, it’s OK,’ he says. ‘I’ve been at Auschwitz every day for weeks.’ ‘I was so frightened.’‘I know. But I’m here now. And I have something to say to you.’‘What?’‘First, let me kiss you.’They kiss, clutching, pressing, passionately, before she pushes him away. ‘What do you want to say?’‘My beautiful Gita. You’ve bewitched me. I’ve fallen in love with you.’89

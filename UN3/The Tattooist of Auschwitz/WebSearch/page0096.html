He’d bribed his old kapo in Block 7 to take Leon in, on the understanding he will work for him when he has regained his strength. He gives him food that he had been planning to give to his Romani friends and to Gita for distribution.As Lale is leaving Leon, Baretski calls out to him. ‘Tätowierer, where have you been? I have been looking for you.’‘I was told I had the day off.’‘Well, you don’t anymore. Come, we have a job.’ ‘I have to get my bag.’‘You don’t need your tools for this job. Come.’Lale hurries after Baretski. They are heading towards one of the crematoria.He catches up with him. ‘Where are we going?’ ‘Are you worried?’ Baretski laughs.‘Wouldn’t you be?’‘No.’Lale’s chest tightens; his breath comes too short. Should he run? If he does, Baretski will surely turn his weapon on him. But then, what would it matter?A bullet is surely preferable to the ovens.They are very close to Crematorium Three before Baretski decides to put Lale out of his misery. He slows his long strides.‘Don’t worry. Now come on before we both get into trouble and end up in the ovens.’‘You’re not getting rid of me?’‘Not just yet. There are two prisoners in here who appear to have the same number. We need you to look at them. It must have been you or that eunuch who made the marks. You have to tell us which one is which.’The red brick building looms in front of them; large windows disguise the purpose, but the size of the chimneys confirms its horrifying true nature. They are met at the entrance by two SS, who joke with Baretski and ignore Lale. They point to closed doors inside the building and Baretski and Lale walk towards them. Lale looks around at this final stretch of the road to death at Birkenau. He sees the Sonderkommandos standing by, defeated, ready to do a job no one on earth would volunteer for: removing corpses from the gas chambers and putting them into the ovens. He tries to make eye contact with them, to let them know he too works for the enemy. 94

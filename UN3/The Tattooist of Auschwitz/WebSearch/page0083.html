‘This is the captain  of  the prisoner team, the Tätowierer.’ Baretski introduces Lale to Schwarzhuber.‘Tätowierer.’ He turns to one of his guards. ‘Have we got something we can play for?’A senior SS takes  a cup  from  a  soldier beside him  and shows  it to his commandant.‘We have this. It will make a more than suitable trophy. The inscription says “1930  World Cup”. I believe the winners were France.’  He shows the trophy to Lale. ‘What do you think?’Before Lale can respond, Schwarzhuber takes the trophy and holds it aloft for everyone to see. The SS cheer. ‘Start the game, and may the best team win.’As Lale jogs back to his team he mutters, ‘May the best team live to see the sun come up tomorrow.’Lale joins his team and they gather in the middle of the field. The spectators cheer. The referee kicks the ball towards the SS team and it’s game on.Ten minutes into the game, the prisoners have scored two goals to nil. While Lale enjoys the goals, common sense prevails when he looks at the angry faces of the SS. He subtly lets his players know to slow it down for the remainder of the half. They have had their moments of glory, and it is now time to let the SS into the game. The half ends two all. While the SS are given drinks during the short break, Lale and his team gather to discuss tactics. Eventually Lale impresses on them that they cannot win this game. It is agreed that to help boost morale for the watching prisoners two more goals can be scored, as long as they lose by one goal in the end.As the second half begins, ash rains down on players and spectators. The crematoria are in action and this core task of Birkenau has not been interrupted by sport. Another goal goes in for the prisoners and another for the SS. As their appallingly inadequate diet begins to tell, the prisoners tire. The SS score two further goals. The prisoners don’t need to throw the game, they simply can’t compete any longer. With the SS two up, the referee blows his whistle for full time. Schwarzhuber makes his way onto the field and presents the trophy to the SS captain, who raises it aloft to muted cheers from the guards and officers present. As the SS make their way back to their barracks to celebrate, Houstek walks past Lale.‘Well played, Tätowierer.’81

Chapter 12Lale doesn’t want to look at the flower anymore, so he leaves his block to throw it away. Baretski is there but Lale ignores him, preferring to head back inside and into his room. Baretski follows him and leans in the doorway. He studies the distraught-looking Lale. Lale is aware that he sits on a lumpy fortune of gems, currency, sausage and chocolate. He grabs his bag and pushes past Baretski, forcing him to turn and follow him outside.‘Wait up, Tätowierer. I need to talk to you.’Lale stops.‘I have a request for you.’Lale remains silent, looking at a point beyond Baretski’s shoulder.‘We – I mean my fellow officers and I – are in need of some entertainment, and as the weather is improving we were thinking of a game of football. What do you think?’‘I’m sure it would be fun for you.’‘Yes, indeed.’Baretski plays the game and waits.Lale eventually blinks. ‘How can I help you?’‘Well,  now  that  you’ve  asked,  Tätowierer,  we  need  you  to find eleven prisoners to take on a team of SS in a friendly match.’Lale considers laughing but  keeps  his  gaze  at the point  over  Baretski’s shoulder. He thinks long and hard about his reply to this bizarre request.‘What, no substitutes?’ ‘No substitutes.’‘Sure,  why  not.’ Where did that  come  from?  There are  a  million other things I could say. Like, ‘Fuck off.’‘Good, great. Get your team together and we’ll meet in the compound in two days’  time – Sunday. Oh, and we’ll bring the ball.’  Laughing loudly, Baretski walks off. ‘By the way, Tätowierer, you can have the day off. There are no transports today.’•Lale spends part of the day sorting his treasure into small bundles. 78

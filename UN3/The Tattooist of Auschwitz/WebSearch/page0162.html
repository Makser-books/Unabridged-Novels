‘Why was your door locked?’ Fredrich asks.‘I do not want to find myself sharing my bed with one of your colleagues, several of whom I have observed have no interest in the girls we bring them.’‘I  see.  You  are  a  good-looking man.  You  know  they would  reward you handsomely if you were so inclined.’‘I’m not.’‘Would you like one of the girls? They’ve already been paid.’ ‘No, thanks.’Fredrich’s eye is caught by a sparkling from the rug. He bends down and picks up the ruby. ‘And what is this?’Lale looks at the gem, surprised.‘Can you explain why you’ve got this, Lale?’‘It must have got caught in the lining of my pocket.’‘Really?’‘Do you think if I had taken it I would have left it there for you to find?’Fredrich considers him. ‘I suppose not.’ He pockets it. ‘I’ll return it to the vault.’‘What did you want to see me about?’ Lale asks, changing the topic.‘I’m being transferred tomorrow, so you’ll be doing the morning run and pick-up on your own from now on.’‘You mean with someone else?’ asks Lale.‘No. You’ve proven you can be trusted; the general’s very impressed with you. Just keep doing what you’re doing, and when it’s time for everyone to leave here there might even be a little bonus for you.’‘I’m sorry to see you go. I’ve enjoyed our conversations in the truck. Look after yourself; there’s still a war going on out there.’They shake hands.Once Lale is alone, securely locked in his room, he gathers up the gems on his bed and puts them back in the sock. From the closet he chooses the nicest-looking suit and puts it aside. He lays a shirt and several pairs of underpants and socks on the table, and slots a pair of shoes underneath it.•160

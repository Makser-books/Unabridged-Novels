‘Tätowierer, don’t. You will be watched very closely. Now come on, I’ll take you to work.’As they are leaving the room Lale says, ‘I’m sorry I wasn’t able to get you the nylons you wanted. I’d made arrangements but got derailed.’‘Mm, well, at least you tried. Anyway, she’s not my girlfriend anymore. She dumped me.’‘Sorry to hear that. I hope it wasn’t because of something I suggested you say to her.’‘I don’t think so. She just met someone who is in the same town – hell, the same country – as her.’Lale considers saying something more, but decides to let it drop. Baretski leads him out of his block and into the compound, where a truckload of men has arrived and a selection is taking place. He smiles inwardly at the sight of Leon working, dropping the tattoo stick, spilling ink. Baretski wanders off and Lale approaches Leon from behind.‘Need a hand?’Leon turns around, knocking a bottle of ink over as he grasps Lale by the hand, shaking it vigorously, overjoyed.‘It’s so good to see you!’ he cries.‘Believe me, it’s good to be back. How are you?’‘Still pissing sitting down. Otherwise I’m OK. So much better now that you’re here.’‘Let’s get on with it then. Looks like they’re sending quite a few our way.’ ‘Does Gita know you’re back?’ Leon asks.‘I think so. It was her friend Cilka who got me out.’‘The one who … ?’‘Yes. I’ll try to see them tomorrow. Give me one of those sticks. I’d better not give them any excuse to throw me back where I was.’Leon holds out his tattoo stick as he rummages around in Lale’s bag for another one.  Together they begin work, tattooing the newest residents of Birkenau.•The next afternoon, Lale waits outside the administration building as the girls leave work. Dana and Gita don’t see him until he stands right in front of them, blocking their path. 127

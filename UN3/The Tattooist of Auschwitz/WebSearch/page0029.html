‘And the kapo discovered the truth?’‘No,’ yawns the man, exhausted from work. ‘But the kapo was so pissed off he took Aron anyway.’Lale struggles to contain his tears.The second bunkmate rolls onto his elbow. ‘You put big ideas into his head. He wanted to save “the one”.’‘To save one is to save the world.’ Lale completes the phrase.The men sink into silence for a while. Lale looks at the ceiling, blinks away tears. Aron is not the first person to die here and will not be the last.‘Thank you,’ he says.‘We tried to continue what Aron started, to see if we could save the one.’‘We took turns,’ a young boy says from below, ‘smuggling water and sharing our bread with you, forcing it down your throat.’Another picks up the story. He rises from the bunk below, haggard, with cloudy blue eyes, his voice flat, but still full of the need to tell his part of the story. ‘We changed your soiled clothes. We swapped them with someone who had died overnight.’Lale is now unable to stop the tears that roll down his emaciated cheeks. ‘I can’t …’He can’t do anything but be appreciative. He knows he has a debt he cannot repay, not now, not here, realistically not ever.He falls asleep to the soulful sound of Hebrew chants from those who still cling to faith.•The next morning Lale is in the queue for breakfast when Pepan appears by his side, takes his arm quietly and steers him away towards the main compound. There the trucks unload their human cargo. He feels as though he has wandered into a scene from a tragic play. Some of the actors are the same, most are new, their lines unwritten, their role not yet determined. His life experience has not equipped him to understand what is happening. He has a memory of being here before. Yes, not as an observer, but a participant. What will my role be now?  He closes his eyes and imagines he is facing another version of himself, looking at the left arm. It is unnumbered. Opening his eyes again, he looks down at the tattoo on his real left arm, then back to the scene in front of him.27

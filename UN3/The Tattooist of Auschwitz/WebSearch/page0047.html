•For what seems like a long time Lale walks among his fellow prisoners, chatting to those he knows from Block 7. All the while his eyes search the groups of girls. He is talking to Leon when the tiny hairs rise on the back of his neck, the tickling sensation of being watched. He turns. There she is.She is chatting with three other girls. Noticing that he has seen her, she stops. Lale walks towards the girls and her friends step back, putting a little distance between them and the stranger; they have heard about Lale. She is left standing alone.He comes close to the girl, drawn again to her eyes. Her friends giggle quietly in the background. She smiles. A small, tentative smile. Lale is almost rendered speechless. But he summons the courage. He hands her the bread and letter. In it, unable to stop himself, he has told her how he can’t stop thinking about her.‘What’s your name?’ he asks. ‘I need to know your name.’ Behind him someone says, ‘Gita.’Before he is able to do or say anything more, Gita’s friends rush to her and drag her away, whispering questions as they go.That night, Lale lies on his bed saying her name over and over. ‘Gita. Gita. What a beautiful name.’•In Block 29 in the women’s camp Gita curls up with her friends Dana and Ivana. A  beam from a floodlight seeps through a small crack in the timber wall, and Gita strains to read Lale’s letter.‘How many times are you going to read it?’ Dana asks.‘Oh, I don’t know, until I know every word off by heart.’ Gita replies. ‘When will that be?’‘About two hours ago,’ Gita giggles. Dana hugs her friend tightly.•The next morning Gita and Dana are the last to leave their block. They exit with their arms linked, talking, oblivious to their surroundings. Without warning the SS officer outside their block hits Gita in the back with his rifle. Both girls crash to the ground. Gita cries out in pain. He indicates with his rifle for them to get up. They stand, their eyes downcast.He looks at them with disgust and snarls, ‘Wipe the smile from your face.’45

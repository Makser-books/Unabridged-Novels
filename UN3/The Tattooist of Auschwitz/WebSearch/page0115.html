‘Once we leave here and I can fatten you up a little, we will have babies, and they will be beautiful babies; they will take after their mother.’‘Thank you, my love. You make me want to believe in a future.’‘Good. Does that mean you will tell me your surname and where you come from?’‘Not yet. I told you, on the day we leave this place. Please don’t ask me again.’•After parting from Gita, Lale seeks out Leon and a few others from Block 7. It’s a beautiful summer’s day and he intends to enjoy the sun and his friends while he can. They sit against the wall of one of the blocks. Their conversation is simple. At the sound of the siren, Lale says his goodbyes and makes his way back to his block. As he nears the building he senses something is wrong. The Romani children stand around, not running to meet him, but stepping aside as he walks by. He greets them, but they don’t respond. He understands why immediately when he opens the door to his room. Displayed on his bed are the gems and currency from under his mattress. Two SS officers are waiting.‘Care to explain this, Tätowierer?’ Lale can find no words.One of the officers snatches Lale’s bag from his hands and empties his tools and ink bottles onto the floor. Then they put the bounty into the bag. With pistols drawn they face Lale squarely and motion for him to move. The children stand aside as Lale is marched out of the Gypsy camp for what he believes will be the last time.•Lale stands in front of Houstek, the contents of his bag spread out over the Oberscharführer’s desk.Houstek picks up and examines each precious stone and piece of jewellery, one at a time. ‘Where did you get all this?’ he asks, not looking up.‘Prisoners gave it to me.’‘Which prisoners?’‘I do not know their names.’Houstek looks up at Lale, sharp. ‘You don’t know who gave you all this?’ ‘No, I do not.’113

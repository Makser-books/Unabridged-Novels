She suggests that Mrs Goldstein empty the toilet buckets each night, a task usually given to a person chosen each day by the kapo, often someone she believes has spoken badly of her. The kapo’s price is a diamond ring. She’s heard the rumours of Lale’s treasure chest. The deal is struck.•For the next several weeks, Lale goes to Auschwitz every day. The five crematoria are working to full capacity, but large numbers of prisoners still have to be tattooed. He receives his instructions and supplies from the administration building at Auschwitz. He has no time and no need to go to the administration building at Birkenau, so he has no opportunity to see Gita. He wants to get a message to her that he is safe.Baretski is in a good, even a playful mood – he has a secret and he wants Lale to guess what it might be. Lale plays Baretski’s juvenile game.‘You’re letting us all go home?’Baretski laughs and punches Lale on the arm. ‘You’ve been promoted?’‘You’d better hope not, Tätowierer. Otherwise someone not as nice as me will end up minding you.’‘OK, I give up.’‘I’ll tell you then. You’re all going to be given extra rations and blankets next week for a few days. The Red Cross are coming to inspect your holiday camp.’Lale thinks hard.  What can this mean?  Will the outside world finally see what is happening here? He works to keep his emotions in check in front of Baretski.‘That will be nice. Do you think this camp will pass the humanitarian test of imprisonment?’Lale can see Baretski’s brain ticking over, almost hear the little clicks. He finds his lack of comprehension amusing, though he doesn’t dare smile.‘You’ll be well fed for the days they are here – well, those of you we let them see.’‘So it will be a controlled visit?’‘Do you think we’re stupid?’ Baretski laughs. Lale lets that question pass.88
